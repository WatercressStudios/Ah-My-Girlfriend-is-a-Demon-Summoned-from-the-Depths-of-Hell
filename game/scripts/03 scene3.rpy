    "And suddenly, everything went quiet. An incense-filled smokiness hung in the air."
    "This didn't feel like a dream. It was all too real - down to every grain of salt beneath me."
    "I suppose I ruined the pentagram, but that was the least of my concerns."
    "I could feel a presence in the pitch-black garage, but even with all of the meditation and seances I performed, my eyes had not the power to pierce the ebony veil."
    "My breath was still. I knew I locked the garage door."
    "So, who got in here?"
    pro "..."
    "The realization hit me: it wasn't a question of {i}who{/i}, but of what." 
    "A chill drifted down my spine. My attention immediately focused on the sound of footsteps against the asphalt."

    #sfx echoey footsteps

    "Left foot? Right foot? It was drawing ever closer…"
    "The presence was… unspeakably powerful. And it was drawing closer still."
    "Oh God, please don't hurt me!"
    "I could feel its raspy breath on my neck…"

    q "Wow! Tomato juice! Did you get this for me?"
    pro "..."
    pro "T-Tomato… juice…?"
    q "Oh, hey, this is, like, an offering, right? Oh, you're such a sweetheart!"
    q "Tomato juice is my favourite! Y'know it's rich in Vitamin A, right?"
    q "The other girls make fun of me because it's so sodium-rich and I need to watch my figure…"
    q "...But I think it's perfectly alright to indulge in your favourite things every now and then, isn’t it?"

    "I couldn't make out this person's face through the darkness, but the presence and the voice matched."
    "Were they one and the same? What's the meaning of this…?"

    q "Hey, is there a light in here? Oh, it's over here! Lemme just get that~!"

    #sfx click

    "The lights flickered back to life…"

    "...And before me was an… an oddly dressed girl?"
    "She was dressed in something I could only describe as... something from a tacky magical girl anime."
    "Somehow, it seemed to suit her just fine. She was smiling so giddily the entire time, and could hardly stay still."
    "The girl’s grin  felt familial - like she was a long-time neighbour."
    "...And she also had… devilish horns and bright red skin?"
    "Oh. {i}Oh{/i}. ...What?"
    "This… {i}definitely{/i} wasn't good. I’m not sure why I didn't notice those features earlier, though..."

    q "Y'know, I really appreciate you bringing me tomato juice!"
    q "Because, you see, a lot of people end up doing really gross and creepy things, like using {i}blood{/i} or some ghastly thing like that…"
    q "And they're usually from some poor creature that did nothing wrong… Don't you think that's the saddest thing?"
    q "Like, I feel like, sometimes, people don't really {i}get{/i} me… but you do, don't you?"
    pro "Who… Who are you…?"
    #eyes widen
    q "..."
    #coy smile
    q "...Ihihi!~"

    "That laugh would've sounded cute and inviting in any other circumstance, but before this disastrous altar, it was chilling."

    q "You really don't know who I am, Makoto…?"
    pro "Wha…  How do you know my name?"
    q "Oh I know a lot of things! It's because I have a lot of responsibilities to attend to."
    q "Ahhh, but I guess if you're some country yokel, you probably wouldn't recognize me…"
    q "It's okay, it's okay! I'll reintroduce myself, how's that?"
    pro "C-Country yokel…?"

    "The way she called me that was - to be frank - patronizing and a little insulting, but she said it in such a cheery and pleasant way."
    "It was hard to feel dispirited, even if she insulted you right in your face."

    #we should brainstorm how to best realize the flowery magical girl intro

    q "I'm the one that makes the traffic lights stay red for you, for a whole three minutes at a time!"
    q "I'm the one who calls you on your phone when you're almost done with a full combo on your idol rhythm game!"
    q "And don't you just hate it when you open a bag of popcorn and find loose kernels in it!? Yup, that's me too~!"
    q "I'm Satan of Wrath! And I'm here to bring smiles to the faces of everyone around the world!"

    pro "...Wait, {i}Satan{/i}!?"
    st "Yup! Though my stage name is just S⛧Tan! I'm the world's very first idol, y'know!"
    st "People think I might be too old for it, but that's poppycock! You can be whatever you wanna as long as you put your mind to it!~"
    pro "What youthful sprite says 'poppycock...?"
    st "I have a colourful vocabulary! Ah, but enough about me…"
    st "Let's talk about you~!"
    pro "...M-Me?"

    "Despite her playful expression, I felt my skin writhing. Was this all a guise to seduce me? To lower my defences?"
    "This {i}is{/i} Satan, after all. Her cunning is unparalleled."

    st "I wanted to wish you, congratulations!"
    pro "...Con-Congratulations?"
    st "{b}Congratulations~!{/b}"
    pro "I-I heard you the first time!"
    st "Yes, congratulations! You're the Hell Hotline's 666,666th customer! Give yourself a big round of applause!"

    #sfx  applause

    "As she beamed, an uproarious applause filled the garage. From where specifically, it was impossible to tell."
    "Cautiously, I clapped along. Is this the power of a true demon? To influence those around you?"

    pro "...Wh-Where's the applause coming from?"
    st "Don't worry about it too much! I'd say there are more important things to talk about."
    pro "Right, right, so… so, like, did you come to take my soul?"
    pro "For some kind of dark pact? Signing a contract in blood, that sort of thing?"
    st "Blood!? No, no! That's such a creepy, stalker-ish thing to do!"
    st "Asking for a signature in blood... Who would even {i}think{/i} about something so crazy?"
    st "Not me, no sirree! I'm not here to claim your soul!"
    pro "Oh… Uh, well… that's a relief."
    st "...Not {i}yet.{/i}"
    pro "For a second I thought you were going to rain fiery death upon the ashen Earth and--"
    pro "Wait, 'not yet?'"
    st "Ohhh, don't worry about it! It's all part of the {b}amazingly hellish deal{/b} we have to offer you~!"

    "She beamed."
    "She carried herself with such radiant, carefree aplomb it was almost blinding. I couldn't lower my defences - not even an inch."

    pro "...You make it sound like you're trying to unload some kind of timeshare off on me."
    st "Ahh, yeah… I've had to take up part-time work."
    st "The economy's really hard for a pure, innocent idol, just trying to bring joy to the world. We haven't sold out an event in centuries..."
    pro "Wait, alright, hold on, what was that about a--"
    st "And we don't even make any money off of merchandise and syndication! Isn't that a real tragedy?"
    st "Sometimes I wonder if people out there know what we're really all about…"
    "Finally feeling a tinge of pity, I sighed. It was hard not to give her the benefit of the doubt."
    pro "Yeah, it-it's terrible."
    st "Yeah, right? I knew you'd understand!"
    st "You're different from everyone else! I think you can really make a difference in the world~!"
    pro "...That's… odd to hear from you."
    pro "Like, considering you're, uh, Satan. Ruler of the Damned, et cetera."
    st "...Huh? I-I don't speak Latin."

    "You have {i}got{/i} to be kidding…"

    st "And I'm in characterrr! It's 'S⛧Tan', silly! And don't forget the pentagram~!"
    pro "How would you even begin to pronounce--"
    st "Anyway! I have a {b}positively sinful deal{/b} for your perusal! If I can have just a moment of your time…"
    pro "I'm not too privy on any 'deal' that would involve me trading my immortal soul. Just gonna state that up front."

    st "Oh no no, I'm not going to put you on the spot like that! See, the fantastic, amazing, hellishly good deal iiiiis…"
    st "A free trial of our summoning services!"
    pro "Free… trial?"
    st "That's what you wanted, right? To make a demon your familiar?"
    st "I mean, why else would you go through aaaaall this effort~?"

    "She smiled at me with expectant eyes, like an orphan expectantly hoping to be given a new home."

    pro "Well, that's not {i}exactly{/i} what I…"
    pro "Wait. If I summoned a demon, then… then their power would be my power, yes?"
    st "Yes, yes! You two would be partners, you see. Tied together and knotted like an infernal pretzel!"
    st "I like strawberry-dipped pretzels, myself… they're sweet {i}and{/i} salty~!"

    "Rubbing my chin, I pondered the offer."

    pro "Then, if… if I had a demon as my familiar…"
    pro "...Unspeakable power would be at my fingertips. The mortal realm would be but soft, malleable clay within my iron grip."
    pro "...Yes. Yes, I like the sound of that! An extremely powerful demon at my disposal…"
    st "And they'll try their best every day, because that's what's really important!"
    pro "And, again, you say I won't have to put my soul up as collateral?"
    st "It's a free trial in every way you can imagine!"
    st "No credit card details, no payments, no forfeiture of your immortal soul for as long as the trial period lasts!"

    "The demon kept piquing my interest. Perhaps this was the chance of a lifetime - a trial period to exact revenge on humanity for its malice and hubris."
    "I could dream big. Existence is transient in the hands of a demon lord."

    pro "...And how long does this, ah, {i}mercy period{/i} last?"
    st "You get one month of our services absolutely free! No strings attached~!"
    pro "Well… this mercy period, I daresay… decidedly lacks mercy, ufufu."
    pro "{i}Veni vidi vici{/i}, as they say in Rome! The planets swirl for Sebastian Wolfgang IV alone!"
    st "Ooh, such bloodcurdling enthusiasm~!"
    pro "It's difficult not to get excited with the Princess of All Darkness at my side, Sa-- ...S⛧Tan."

    "Admittedly, uttering that trite nickname was a struggle - even for me. But it'd have to become habit if we were to rule this world together."
    st "...Eh? Oh, I… oh no, that isn't…"
    pro "Whatever is the matter? The world is but a stage, and we are its playwrights!"
    st "I think you have the wrong idea."
    st "You see, it's not {i}me{/i} who's gonna be your familiar."

    "She frowned so obtusely, but her eyes looked me over with pity."

    pro "...What? But it was your visage that I brought to this world, was it not?"
    st "Not quite. See, I'm just a part-timer, here to show you the ropes, make sure everything's running smooth… That sort of thing."
    st "I… I can't be your familiar, you see! I have a celibate image I have to maintain."
    st "Being seen in proximity with a cute, younger boy would be a media scandal."
    pro "'Cute?’ I-I'm not cute, I'm… I'm rugged as heck!"
    st "Ohhh, you sweet summer child…"

    "Now she was smiling at me, but with even more pity in her expression than before!"
    "I could feel my face fill with red. Absolutely infuriating! This was, undoubtedly, her true potential as Satan of Wrath."
    "How old does she think she is!? ...Actually, that's a question better left unanswered."

    st "No, no, you'd be hooked up with another demon!"
    pro "This is starting to sound like a seedy dating service..."
    st "Ah, no, nothing that pathetic or lonely!"
    st "I bet they're dying to meet you! Alright, quiet, quiet, I'm gonna call them over~!"
    st "...Ah, but I'm gonna need you to close your eyes for this. It makes the magic stronger, you see!"
    pro "...Really? But, you're a demon, and summoning isn't quite the same as a charlatan's magic trick."
    st "Truuue, but special effects cost a lotta money, and I'm trying my best to save for my career… {i}Pleeeease?{/i}"
    "The demoness flashed me the saddest pair of puppy-dog eyes I had ever seen. What a pitiful display…"
    pro "...Well, fine, if that's the case…"
    st "{b}Yes! Okay then, {i}nooo{/i} peeking!"
    scene black with dissolve
    "I closed my eyes to brace myself. This all felt so childlike, but… I had high hopes for what had yet to come."
    "Oh, how wrong I was…"
