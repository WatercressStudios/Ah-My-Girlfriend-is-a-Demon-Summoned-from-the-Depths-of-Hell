    "We are as mortals, after all. Without the blessings of the auspicious, we are as clay in the mud - without form, without the spark of divinity."
    "I am only a man; granted, one that has witnessed a millenia of barbarism, but I'd probably need a little help."

    "I have repurposed my parents’ garage to serve as an altar for the blackest of dark arts." 
    "They… probably won't mind - I hope. To be safe, I'll clean up before they get back."
    "In all likelihood, they're engaging in {i}some{/i} kind of wicked vice regardless. They're off in Kamakura, doing whatever it is adults do on their anniversary."
    "The garage’s design is perfect for my aspirations. I have been burning incense for the past fifteen minutes in preparation..."
    "A white and a black candle are placed on two sides. The white, symbolizing the hypocrisies of those who would deride the darkest magics…"
    "...And the black candle, to serve as a representation {i}of{/i} those darkest magics. Balanced in equilibrium."
    "And, upon completion, I need only to raise the doors and release this ashen hellfire upon the world."

    "...There are greater powers to consult."
    "I will make an offering to the Dark One, then consort and make a bargain for yet greater power - power that will overcome the greatest tribulation I have encountered yet."
