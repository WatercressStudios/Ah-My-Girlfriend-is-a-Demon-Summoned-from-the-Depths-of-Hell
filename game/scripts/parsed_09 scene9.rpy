    "Akumahou High School - a modern-day prison that traps and contains the darkness I have grown so fond of."
    "Within these bland, uninviting borders, I am nothing more than an average high-schooler, carrying out the most mundane of business."
    "Every single student is indistinguishable from the rest, like a pack of ghosts on their way to the netherrealm."
    "There’s no joy to be found here - just a cold and uncaring society that has no tolerance for the old ways."
    "But the day has come where I shed off those shackles at long last! There’s no need to doubt myself now."
    "My power has grown ever stronger since I first started coming here… and now is the time to reveal my magic to the world."
    "And yet… something is amiss."
    "I’ve only gotten halfway across the school courtyard and I’m already exhausted."
    "This hasn’t happened before… Did last night’s summoning drain more of my power than I realized?"
    "No, it can’t be. I feel perfectly fine - if a little heavier than usual."
