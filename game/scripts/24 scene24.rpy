    "It’s another ordinary day for the students of Akumahou High School."
    "Yet another long, tiresome day of sitting through endless lectures; the students accept their fate and absorb knowledge like flies."
    "There are those who look forward to the oncoming weekend, but have their excitement dulled by the ever-present monotony."
    "And by the time they get to enjoy the weekend, they find that they must return back to school and the cycle begins anew."
    "Yet on this particular day - at this particular moment in time - my enthusiasm cannot be quelled."
    "The day has finally come -  the moment I’ve been waiting for ever since that fateful encounter two days ago…"

    "My final showdown with Misaki Tendou, better known as Countess Elizabeth, the Everlasting Matriarch of the Forgotten Realms."
    "She has been a thorn in my side ever since she challenged my authority, remaining one step ahead of me wherever I go."
    "She even went as far as to perform the same demon summoning ritual … The nerve of her."
    "But she won’t be able to get the upper hand on me any longer."
    "I’m prepared now, more than ever, to show her who deserves to lead the Occult Club."
    "It’s almost sad to know that this may very well be our last showdown… but that’s why it’s all the more important to make this a fight worth remembering."

    "Honestly, it’s the only thing I’ve been thinking about all day."
    "I’ve hardly been paying attention to any of the lectures lately… Well, I can always study later, I guess."
    "But as soon as the bell rings…"

    #sfx bell ring

    "*RING!*"

    "I bolt out of my seat and head towards our meeting place."
    "But… something feels off."
    "It took me longer than usual to fling my backpack over my shoulders and make my way out the door."
    "I don’t think it was this heavy when I came in today… and no curse was placed upon it to make it heavier, either."
    "..."
    "...Oh, wait."
    "I know exactly what’s going on."
    "With a passive sigh, I roll my eyes, take off my backpack, and open it up."

    pro "Alright, Beepy, come on out."

    "My hunch is right. As soon as I unzip my backpack, Beepy emerges, stretching."

    bp "Aww… I was hoping to surprise you during your big fight."
    pro "What’re you doing here? I thought I said I had to do this myself."
    bp "You know I can’t allow that."
    bp "Letting you do this by yourself means having to take on both Misaki and Satan."
    bp "Which, honestly isn’t too hard… Actually, you could probably do it if you tried hard enough."
    pro "Y-Yeah, so--"
    bp "But I’m still technically bound to you. And I wouldn’t be a very good partner if I didn’t help you out with this."
    bp "I mean, this whole thing is still really dumb and petty, but I’d rather help you out than leave you fighting by yourself."

    #show Beepy smiling

    bp "So… it’s alright. You can rely on me."
    pro "Beepy…"

    "That’s right… I can rely on her."
    "I had been so focused on doing things myself that I didn’t realize it until now."
    "Beepy… she’s been helping me out for the past couple days."
    "And not just her, but Lucy, Mami, and Bubble too. They all want me to succeed."
    "I haven’t had the chance to properly thank them yet, but there’ll be plenty of time for that once this is all over."
    "I’m still not sure what to make of myself after all they’ve taught me, but…"
    "All I know for certain now, is… I’m not alone."

    pro "...Hey, Beepy, quick question."

    #show Beepy tired

    bp "Hm?"
    pro "How are you able to sneak into my backpack like that?"
    bp "Oh, that. Well…"
    bp "You know how a cat can fit into almost any space if it tries hard enough?"

    #show Beepy smiling

    bp "It’s kinda like that. I’m pretty flexible, so small spaces aren’t a problem for me."
    pro "Right, but… that still doesn’t explain how you snuck in without me noticing."
    bp "Dude, I’m like, really good at being stealthy."
    bp "There was this one time where I snuck into Satan’s room and--"

    bp "Oh… Nevermind. I’ll tell you later."

    #enter Misaki stage left

    "In an instant, Beepy’s bragging is brought to a halt by… her."
    "My fated rival - her eyes blazing brighter than supernova - approaches me without a moment to spare."

    riv "I’ve been looking for you ever since the bell rung! We were supposed to meet on the roof for our final battle, remember!?"
    riv "Don’t tell me you’ve decided to chicken out now!"

    "Your empty taunts won’t work on me any longer, {i}Elizabeth.{/i}"
    "I strike a fancy pose and get myself into character once more."

    pro "Oh, I had no intention of running. I was just doing some last-minute strategizing with my demonic servant!"
    pro "Isn’t that right, Beepy!?"
    bp "Huh? Oh… Uh…"
    bp "We’re gonna totally beat you up, and stuff."

    "Real smooth, Beepy."

    #show Misaki confident

    riv "Hehehehe~ Is that a fact?"
    riv "Well, I’ll have you know that me and {i}my{/i} servant have been training nonstop these past few Earth days."
    riv "And now, we are at a height reachable by no other being - not even you, Sebastian!"
    riv "It will be most amusing to see you groveling at my feet as I claim that which is rightfully mine!"
    pro "Don’t be so sure of yourself, Countess Elizabeth, for it shall be {i}you{/i} that falls before the combined might of me and {i}my{/i} servant!"
    pro "You shall finally see that the stars have been aligned in my favor all along!"

    "The sparks of our rivalry intensify with every retort."
    "It’s hard to believe it’s all built up to this moment, but we’re so close to finally settling this."
    "She may brag all she wants, but we both know who’s going to come out on top in the end…"

    bp "By the way, I meant to ask you earlier, but…"
    bp "...What’s with that extra set of clothes?"
    pro "Huh? Oh, you mean in my backpack?"
    pro "Don’t worry about that, my faithful companion… You’ll find out soon enough."
    bp "I dunno why, but… I’ve got a bad feeling about this."
