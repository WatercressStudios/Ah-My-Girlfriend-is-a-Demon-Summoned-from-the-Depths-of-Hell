    "Eventually, the car stops. The doors open and everyone moves out, eager to get their feet onto solid land again."

    "The supermarket."
    "A place of sheer, unadulterated anarchy - a place where mortals trample over one another to get the best deals on their bread and water."
    "A place where the fat cats indulge in capitalistic greed, preying on the needs of the weary in order to surround themselves with hedonistic pleasures."
    "It is a place of human fault, but also a place of demonic prevalence."
    "Regardless, the group in front of me seemed to be enjoying it."

    bb "{i}Whooooooaaaahhhhhhhhh!{/i}"
    mm "So this is the place we're getting our ingredients from?"
    sis "Yep. This is the supermarket."
    bb "So cool!"

    "Lucifer stands away from the rest of the group, looking at the street around her. Her eyes stop, focusing on a shop on the other side. She seems almost fixated in a way. I can’t help but look."
    "..."
    "The place seems to be an… arts and crafts shop of some sort? I don't quite know what's inside, and I don't quite care either. I turn back to the main group, walking towards them as they continue to look at the store."

    bb "So wait, there's… food in there?"
    sis "Yeah. You take whatever you need from the shelves and then you buy it at the checkout."
    mm "Wait, so, people here spend their money on stuff that doesn't stay?"
    sis "...Yeah? We sorta, like, need to eat, after all."
    mm "Interesting. Looks like you guys will do--"

    "Mammon is interrupted by her sister, who begins to jump up and down on the spot like some kind of excited schoolgirl."

    bb "Can we go in? Can we go in? Can we? Can we!?"
    pro "Of course. That is where we’ll gather the ingredients we need."

    "Somehow, my dull tone did nothing to deter her excitement."

    bb "Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!"
    lu "Um…"
    sis "Hey, could you be a little quieter? People are gonna notice you screaming."
    mm "Actually, they'd notice {i}you,{/i} since you're like, talking to yourself and stuff."
    lu "Can we, uh--"
    sis "So there's nothing I can do about… {i}this?{/i}"
    mm "Nope. Once you get her like this there's no going back."
    pro "Fantastic."

    "It is at this point that Lucifer decides to interrupt our conversation."

    lu "Can we, uh, go to that art store over there?"

    "Again, it didn’t interest me, but I suppose that we could at the very least humour her if we have the time."

    lu "It's just, um, that I sorta want to - um, like, try doing art again? Try seeing if I can draw this time? I, um, understand if that's not something we can do but, um…"
    lu "..."
    lu "...Please?"

    "Silence, then..."

    sis "Sure. I'll come with you."

    "She turns to me and the other two."

    sis "You'll be fine doing the shopping, right?"
    pro "Yes."

    "My sister just stares blankly at me for a moment."

    sis "Just make sure you've got those other two under control."
    pro "Alright, ma'a-- uh, Sis…"

    "She sighs, before looking at Lucifer."

    sis "Alright, follow me."
    lu "Alright, uh… thanks, I--"
    sis "Don't mention it."

    "They leave, making sure to look both ways before crossing the street. Once they do so, I turn away and look to the other two."

    pro "So are you two ready to go in?"
    mm "Yep."
    bb "Yeah, yeah!"

    "I supposed it was time for me to find out how much I was going to enjoy their company."
    "Probably not much, but I’m an optimist at heart."

    pro "Alright, let us enter this abode, then."

    "..."

    "The supermarket."
    "As I said before, a place of many things: discounts, greed, and human vulnerability especially. I learned this from an early age by simply observing people…"
    "One thing that I seemed to had forgotten was that the supermarket was a place of sheer, bitter cold."

    scene marketinside

    "The three of us walked down the aisles of this maze; I pushed the trolley in front of me while music that could only have been written by Beleth played on the loudspeakers above."
    "We were about a third of the way through our grocery list - foodstuffs which could help replenish my mana for the upcoming fight - as we went down yet another aisle."
    "I check the selection - or I try to, at least. This whole wall seems to be covered in different brands of eggs. Is there any difference between them? Does it matter which type of unborn cockatrice I choose to eat?"
    "I don't know. It doesn't really matter, either. I reach my hand forward to the cheapest carton and--"

    bb "{i}{b}No!{/b}{/i}"

    "A force appears at breakneck speed and bats my hand away just as I am about to grab the eggs. My body jolts. I look around. Is this an attack? Do I need to fight? I'm not sur--"

    bb "Don't take those!"

    "As it turns out, it is only Bubble. I let my my eyes bore into her until she further elaborates on why she just did what she did."

    bb "Those are caged eggs, those are bad!"
    pro "...Why?"
    bb "Those aren't made to be healthy, those are made to be cheap! You can't work with those if you want to make good food!"

    "I suppose it is only fitting that the spirit of gluttony is, itself, a picky eater."
    "Oh well, I suppose I will humour her… {i}wishes,{/i} or whatever the word is."

    pro "What would you propose I use instead?"

    "She leans over the railing, pointing at a brand of eggs on the top shelf."
    "They seem to be considerably more expensive than the ones I was planning on taking."

    bb "These are free range! These are good to eat!"
    mm "My sis here gets sorta particular about food. Just warning you now."

    "Too little too late. I lean forward, grabbing the eggs from the top shelf, and place them carefully in the trolley."
    "All my hard earned money, gone. I sigh, begin to push forward, and--"

    #This line is Satan’s.
    st "Hey! You guys!"

    "A familiar voice calls, and I turn to see S_Tan walking down the aisle and waving to us. Sure enough, Misaki walks behind her, looking down at the ground as she pushes her own cart forward."
    "Great."
    "Just what I needed."

    mm "Yo, S_Tan~!"
    bb "Sati~!"

    "The two demons move forward, their ensuing reunion as loud and overbearing as possible. I look to see if there is anything else here I need until..:"

    riv "Uh, hi."
    pro "Hello."

    "Her tone is curt, slightly irritated. Her words are short. Stuttered. It seems unlike the Countess I knew before."
    "That doesn’t bother me in the slightest. I turn back to the aisle, and-"

    riv "Move."
    pro "Excuse me?"
    riv "I-i need to go p-past you. Move."

    "I suppose it would be unwise to cause a scene. I do as instructed. Misaki moves forward, heading to the self checkout at the end of the corridor."
    "She sends a card through it and begins to place her items there - a {i}beep{/i} sounding for each one."
    "I look away, focused on my own task. The next item on this list seems to be butter, which is attainable. I move, head along the aisle, and--"

    riv "{b}Fuck!{/b}"

    "I jolt at the sudden noise and look to its source. Misaki is still at the machine, only one or two products away from finishing. An angry expression is scrawled across her face, but I'm not exactly sure why."

    "Against my better judgement, I ask."

    pro "What's wrong?"

    "She looks at me, staring for a second."

    riv "I-i don't have enough money. I only have a hundred, and..."

    "She trails off, looking away for a moment."

    pro "Do you need everything there?"
    riv "Y-Yes. I-i need to, um…"
    riv "..."
    riv "I need to, um, replenish my mana for our fight."

    "She needs to replenish her power?"
    "Hmph."
    "I suppose I understand. Magic - {i}summoning{/i} to be more specific - was taxing. If the summoner wasn't in peak condition, then the spell would simply burn the flesh in order to meet its cost."
    "Obviously, I did not want to try and summon without the required mana."
    "And somehow, I doubted that even Misaki was foolish enough to do so."
    "If she wasn’t able to replenish her stamina, then she would hardly be ready for our showdown."
    "But was there any satisfaction to be found in that sort of victory?"
    "No!"
    "It was hollow at best."
    "And for the Demon Lord Sebastian Wolfgang IV, hollow simply wasn't good enough."
    "I walked over to Misaki, bringing my wallet out with a sigh."

    pro "How, uh, much do you need?"

    "She paused. Glared at me."

    riv "There’s no need for you to do that."
    pro "I want to."

    "She pauses again. Looks away, for a moment…"

    riv "Fine."

    "And finally put the last of her items under the scanner."

    riv "$12."

    "That amount seemed pitiful. I reached into my wallet and pulled three $5 bills out, then gave them to her."

    pro "You can keep the change."

    "The noise that initially comes out of her mouth is akin to a growl, but she stops and collects herself."

    riv "...Thanks."
    pro "You're welcome."

    "I try to give the best smile I can. Just for her. Just for today, before we meet again."

    q "Aww, you guys are so cute together!"

    "S_Tan walks over to the two of us, Mammon and Beelzebub behind her."

    q "Y'know, I bet you two would make, like, really good friends!"

    #both say at same time
    riv "No we wouldn't."
    pro "No we wouldn't."

    "Silence, for a moment. We look - {i}glare{/i} - at each other before they erupt into laughter. Mammon and Satan giggle; Beelzebub collapses, breathless."

    "The confusion is palpable. I look at the group, trying to understand their laughter."

    #both say at same time
    riv "Why are you laughing?"
    pro "Why are you laughing?"

    "More laughter. Mostly from them, some - a brief chuckle - from me. The humour in the room is surprisingly infectious."

    st "Yeah, definitely. You two would get along {i}so{/i} well with one another."

    "Unlikely, but I suppose for now I - {i}we{/i} - will humour the possibility."
