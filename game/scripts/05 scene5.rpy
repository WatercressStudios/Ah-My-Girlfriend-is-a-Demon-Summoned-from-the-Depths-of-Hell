    "Entering my room, I'm careful to close the door behind me. All the better to cut off any escape routes."
    "Of course, she could just go out the window - or use magic or {i}something.{/i} I guess it's really a useless gesture…."

    pro "Alright, where did she… oh."

    "I spot a curious lump beneath my sheets."

    bp "Zzz~"
    pro "Jeez, you conk out easily, don't you…?"
    bp "It's my… amazing power… I can fall asleep anywhere…"
    pro "W-Wait, you heard that!?"
    bp "Zzzzz…"
    pro "A-Alright, enough joking around. Get up! This is {i}my{/i} bed."
    bp "Nn… Don't you mean {i}our{/i} bed…?"

    #beepy enter from below

    "She slowly rose from her slumber, sullenly staring at me."

    pro "Wh-What do you mean!? My bed can't even {i}fit{/i} two people!"
    bp "Pfft. Some magician you are…"
    pro "No, I mean, it's physically… I-it's out of the question!"
    pro "A-And I'm not a magician! I’m a sorcerer - a master of the arcane!"
    bp "That's why you wear the gaudy cape, right…?"
    bp "Haaaaahn…"

    "Sitting up straight, she stretches and yawns. Her mannerisms were terribly cat-like…" 
    "The smell of lavender and jasmine filled the room. Was that Beepy's scent? It’s easier to tell, now that it's just the two of us…"
    "She wasn't taking me seriously at all. Her eyes listlessly drifted around the room."

    bp "So this's your room, right? It's plainer than I expected."
    pro "P-Plain…?"
    bp "I mean, with your ridiculous get-up, I expected a bunch of screamo posters."
    bp "Skulls, too. Edgy stuff."
    pro "Material possessions are fleeting. The eternal demon king’s throne is built on a foundation of diligent study - not transient property."
    bp "Oy, can you use smaller words? I just woke up…"
    bp "Seriously, is that really your gimmick? I thought kids grew out of that stuff after junior high…" 
    pro "I-It's not a gimmick! This is who I really am!"
    pro "And if I'm to reign supreme over this wretched existence, I must come to understand your powers in full!"
    pro "To understand so I can reach in, and grasp but a microcosm of that power for myself."
    bp "Is this how you introduce yourself to every girl…?"
    bp "Ever heard of ‘hello, how are you?’"

    "Under Beepy’s piercing, incredulous look, I felt my resolve ebb away."
    "Eventually, she shrugged her shoulders."

    bp "Well, it's not complicated. Demons are supposed to coerce humans into indulging their vices."
    bp "Sooo… I'm a demon of sloth, so it's pretty much me being cute and lazy. I don't know what else to tell you, uguu~"

    "Even her uguu sounded disingenuous! Why couldn’t I get S⛧Tan? Either way..."

    pro "That… can't be all. You're a demon, right?"
    bp "Well, no. I have other talents."
    bp "I have an eidetic memory - though it's pretty much dedicated to takeout menus."
    pro ".This is ridiculous! What am I supposed to do with a-a demon that just eats and sleeps!?"
    bp "I ‘ono. I kinda like having a roommate."
    bp "Sorry for disappointing you, I guess? I should probably be more sprightly and upbeat like Satan is…"
    bp "Buuuut I really don't have the energy for it."
    pro "You mean, uh, S⛧Tan?"
    bp "...Yes, her."

    "She grimaced at the sound of that tacky name. Truth be told, it was obtuse just to say aloud."

    pro "I was wondering if you actually knew each other."
    bp "Siblings. We're siblings. She's always been one to try and force everyone into doing whatever weird shit she feels like."
    bp "Even her… dumb idol troupe thing. It's way too much effort to deal with."
    pro "Wait, what idol troupe? Y-You're in on it, aren’t you?"
    bp "...You're better off not knowing the details. Trust me."
    pro "B-But it's my mandate as a Demon Lord! To… to bring and bear the deceits of the truth!"
    bp "What does that even mean? Seriously, forget it; it's dumb."
    "She continued to half-heartedly dodge the issue, but the discomfort in her face was palpable."
    "Smirking to myself, I had identified a chink in her armour - away to render her defences moot and reduce her life points to zero."
    pro "...She must have a fair bit of sway over you to get you to dress up like that."
    bp "Aaaagh, stooop…"

    #beep exit to below 


    "She groaned, burying her head into a pillow."

    pro "I gotta say, that sounds positively adorable~"

    #move beepy slightly up so you only see her eyes

    bp "Noooo, it's embarrassinggg…"

    "This change in behaviour was absolutely delicious - especially given the dumb looks Beepy had given me so far. In fact, it all felt deliciously karmic."

    bp "She's so insistent, and just begs and begs and... Ugh, it's annoying!"
    bp "You can hold out for a hundred years - but eventually, you have to cave just to shut her up."
    pro "Oh, huh... It's not some dark brainwashing power, she's just… bratty."

    "That revelation was particularly disappointing. I had hoped to maybe harness her powers of suggestion for myself."
    "Apparently, it amounts to begging until you get what you want. Who could've known?"

    #beep rises back to center stage

    bp "Hoo… Alright, whatever, I'll deal."
    bp "Now, let's hear something from you."
    pro "What? Why me?"
    bp "We're getting to know each other, right? Generally, {i}normal{/i} people try to learn more about each other."
    pro "D-Don't condescend to me! I'm your master, after all! I cannot tolerate that level of in-insubordination from my underlings!"
    bp "Oh sweetie, you're not a high enough level to order me around like that…"

    "She was smiling! This… This harpy…!"

    bp "C'mon, what's your game? Why go through all of the effort of a demon summoning thingamabob?"
    bp "There was a point to it all, right…?" 
    pro "Uh…"
    pro "...Actually, yes. That’s right."
    pro "This entire exercise was born from a wager - a game with implications for the entirety of this fleeting, rotting world."
    bp "...Really?"

    "There’s that… that {i}look{/i} again! Her sardonic judgement only made me up the ante."

    pro "Ufufu… Yes, it is difficult to discern the truth of reality's whims from such a narrowed looking glass."
    pro "I will not bore you with the earth-shattering details… But everything happens for a reason."
    pro "This entire meeting was not through providence alone; it was thanks to the machinations of Sebastian Wolfgang IV!"
    bp "...That's one of the {i}dumbest{/i} things I've ever heard - and S⛧Tan says some dumb crap."
    pro "For what is providence but an attempt to overturn luck - that folly - through sheer force of will? The gods made every effort to handicap me, but I outwitted them at every turn!"
    bp "You're not even listening anymore, are you…?"
    pro "Yes! The game is already won, so I need only to claim my prize! The crown and the deed to this entire pla--"
    bp "Ugh, stoooop, please! Jeez, are we really going to keep up this tired old charade?"
    bp "Sheesh, get over yourself."
    pro "...Wha?"
    bp "Like… don't you have hobbies? Like, {i}normal{/i} hobbies?"
    pro "Ah-- I don't understand."
    pro "What would an exalted demon lord have any use for--"
    bp "Manga, video games, porn, anything! I don’t care what, just stop!"
    bp "Y'know sometimes I have to read some freaky stuff just to doze off… i-if I'm in the mood for it, I mean."
    pro "{i}W-What.{/i}"
    bp "...I mean, I'm not ashamed of it."
    pro "You… sure you're a demon of sloth?"
    bp "We all have our urges!"
    bp "Whatever. I don't really wanna bother just sitting here, getting judged by some loose chuuni prude."
    bp "Talking like this turned out to be way boring. Your gimmick's just… really tired, man."
    bp "I'm gonna see what else is in the house. Catch you later, {i}Sir Demon Lord{/i} or whatever."

    #beepy exit stage left

    "Untangling herself from the covers, she strode to the door and left me to my thoughts once more."

    pro "..."

    "What… {i}is{/i} she? Can she even talk to me like that?"
    "I should feel disgraced or insulted, but I feel like a failure instead."

    pro "...Tch. Basic emotions. I should redouble my efforts."
    pro "I have a plan, after all. This uppity… {i}upstart{/i} can't derail them now!"

    pro "Yes. She is the proof I need."
    pro "I should continue to monitor her…"

    "For whatever reason, I couldn’t put as much heart into my evil schemes as I usually can."
    "The things Beepy said…I might as well have been talking to Yumi."

    pro "No. They are blind to see the... the uh, the entropic circling of the stars above. It… {i}must{/b} be so."
    pro "Yeah. Exactly. I got this."

    "There is a divine purpose to this, after all. I cannot allow my plans to be foiled so easily."

    sis "{b}Makoto!{/b} Are you still in your room!?"
    pro "Crap!"

    "Blasted spawn! If only we hadn't shared the same progenitors."
    "Alas, poor Yumi. She never had the mind to realize her greatness… I can’t help but pity her."

    "Rising from my bed, I turn to the door with a mighty flourish…"

    #sfx crash

    "{b}{i}CRASH!{/b}{/i}"

    "...Aaaand my cape caught the fan on my desk. My head immediately jerked to see the it clatter to the floor."

    pro "...Shit."

    "Straightening my clothes, I make my way back out into the hallway…"
