    pro "...What? How can this be?"
    st "Hmmmmmm… oh, oh, I think I know!"
    pro "Aren't you going to answer my question!?"
    "She wasn't. I could hear her skipping to the other side of the garage."

    st "{b}Hey!{/b} Nooooo peeking! It spoils the magic!"

    st "Okay! You can open your eyes, Makoto~!"
    pro "..."
    "Now that she was actually prompting me to do so… I was hesitant."
    "But I had no other choice. I slowly did as instructed..."

    "...And found S⛧Tan next to another strange-looking girl."

    #note: go back and revise based on Instant's concept!

    "She was cocooned in a comfy-looking robe. Wrapped as snuggly as she was, she almost ready for bed."
    "The dull expression on her face and the way her head tilted forward only provided more validation to that look." 
    "With S⛧Tan and this girl right next to each other, one smiling so brightly and the other… {i}not…{/i}"
    "It really was looking at night and day."
    bp "I was having such a nice dream too… couldn't you let me sleep…?"
    st "C'moooon Beepy! Introduce yourself~!"
    bp "...Do I have to? It's such a chore…"
    bp "And every time I hear you do it, I feel embarrassed by proxy."
    st "All idols need a cute introduction, right? C'mon, you can do it~!"
    bp "I… I never agreed to this idol thing…"
    st "Aw, y'sure? But it's the quickest way to a boy's heart~!"
    bp "Nn… {i}Fiiiine,{/i} I'll do the stupid… idol thing…"
    st "Yaaayy~~!"
    "Stepping back, S⛧Tan eagerly watched as 'Beepy' readied herself."

    #cg for this might be appropriate too idk

    bp "Alright, uhhh… how'd it go again…?"
    bp "Oh, right, uh… y'know that feeling you get… when your paper's due tomorrow, and you go…"
    bp "'Oh, I'll just, eh, diddle uselessly on this MOBA and figure it out later…'"
    bp "Or that feeling when you get, like, 14 hours of sleep and still feel groggy?"
    bp "...Well, oversleeping is bad for you, I guess - so, like, don't do it."
    bp "...Where was I? ...Eh, whatever. I'm Belphegor of Sloth. Can I go now?"
    pro "..."
    st "{i}(That wasn't like we rehearsed…){/i}" 

    #scene garage

    "The girl who called herself Belphegor stared at me with a look not unlike a bored college student who had just delivered a C-grade presentation."
    "...Come to think of it, a C might be a bit too generous."

    st "Way to go! I'm so proud of you, you put in so much effort this time~!"
    bp "...If it's too long, you can just call me Beepy too. It's like, whatever."
    pro "So, Beepy, you're the--"
    st "Yup! She's gonna be your familiar! Isn't this an exciting turn of events?"
    pro "D-Does she have any powers…?"
    bp "One time... I binged a 15-season anime in only a week."
    bp "And that was {i}with{/i} the filler too. I hated it."
    pro "Then… Then why did you watch all of it…?"
    bp "Nothing else was on."
    st "Now then, Makoto, I'm sure you're {i}dying{/i} to get to know each other, so I'll just leave you to it! But before I go…"
    st "I'm gonna give you my personal number! You can call me whenever you need help with anything, okay?"
    #sfx shove
    pro "Oof!"
    "She shoves a business card into my chest with such force that it - quite literally - took my breath away."

    #cg business card

    "True to her word, there's a phone number on the back in excessively ornate writing."

    st "Now don't go sharing that number! It's highly sought after!"
    st "And if some random paper salesperson decides to call me…"
    st "Then I'd know it'd be because of {i}you{/i}. So don't make me upset, okay?"

    "The way she uttered that… it couldn't be interpreted as anything other than threatening."
    "It was so juxtaposed to her bubbly enthusiasm. It was genuinely chilling."
    "I could only nod in affirmation. Beepy was uninterested in the whole thing."
    "As she was with everything, it seemed…"
    "Just as quickly as she’d switched personae,, S⛧Tan lightened up again."

    st "Perfect! Alright, toodles~! Lemme know if you need anything, okay?"
    pro "...S-Sure?"
    st "Okay! Then it seems my work here is done!"

    #scene white with dissolve

    pro "Wha!?"
    "At first, there was silence. S⛧Tan threw some kind of capsule on the ground, but then…"
    "A blinding light engulfed the garage!"

    scene garage

    "And when it cleared, Beepy was sitting there, staring into space." 

    bp "She always does that. It's kinda predictable."
    pro "...What {i}was{/i} that?"
    bp "She just said what it was, didn't she? Jeez, you're stupid…"
    bp "Boy, though… she watches too many shonen anime. Too much excitement." 
    bp "So. You're Makoto Takaya, right?"
    pro "'Makoto?’ ...I suppose that is my given name, yes."
    pro "However… {b}However!{/b} The heart of a demon pulses underneath that unassuming visage. For my true name Is Seba--"
    bp "It’s Makoto, right?"
    pro "..."
    bp "Unless you got some, like, weird roleplay shit going on? What's with the cape?"
    pro "The… th-the cape is… I-I am Sebastian Wolfgang IV, and I will not tolerate--"
    bp "Jeez, alright, you don't have to yell… Sorry I asked."
    pro "Would you stop interrupting me!?"
    bp "Sorry. Every time you take a deep breath like that, it sounds like you're going to mouth off for a while."
    bp "So I kinda just… cut to the chase. Sparknotes version and stuff."

    "Eventually, Beepy stood up - but even then, her posture seemed dull and sluggish."

    bp "...It's drafty in here. I'm gonna go someplace else."

    #beepy exit stage left 

    "Without another word, she stepped out of view."
    "Suddenly alone, I was confronted by the mess left in the strange demon girls' wake."
    "The pentagram was in a mess now, trampled by S⛧Tan's excited running. Beepy didn't pay it any particular mind either."
    "I frowned to myself. I spent so much time on it too…"

    pro "What the hell am I supposed to do now…?"

    "I successfully managed to - against all logic and reason - perform a summoning ritual."
    "I didn't think in a million years that tomato juice would be the decisive factor."
    "...Honestly, I don't know what else I expected. Even then, I didn’t expect {i}this!{/i}"
    "Nor did I expect Satan of all things to be a wannabe idol." 
    "...Wait, if my sister found Belphegor running around the house, she... she'd flip her shit."
    pro "I should find Beepy."

    "When the energy finally returned to my leg, I headed towards the locked door and fiddled with it until it finally opened."

    scene hallway

    pro "...Crap, where is she?"

    "Not here either."
    "She couldn't have gotten far. For someone so tired-looking, she really gets around - and not in the way demons normally do!"
    "It's fine, it's fine. She's probably {i}somewhere.{/i} I just need to--"

    sis "{b}There{/b} you are, Makoto!"
    pro "Ah! Y-Yumi!"

    "I don't know how she manages to sneak up on me like that so easily!"
    "I mean, she came from nowhere! How is that fair!?"
    "Perhaps, if she can teleport, she is my sister after all…"

    sis "What the hell is going on!? There were a lot of weird noises coming from the garage just now!"
    pro "N-Nothing! Nothing at all! Just… practicing… sports."
    sis "...You haven't held any kind of ball since elementary."
    sis "Let me through; I'm taking a look."

    "She tried to shove past me, but I couldn’t let her do that."
    "If Yumi sees the aftermath, then summoning a demon will be the least of my worries!"

    pro "N-No, you can't, because… C-Chemicals! They spilled! Very toxic fumes, not safe… I’m airing the place out."
    sis "I'm not worried! Just… get out of… the {b}way!{/b}"
    pro "N-Nooo!"

    "Placing both arms on my shoulders, she casts me aside like a ragdoll. It seems my resistance was infantile at best…"
    #sfx thud

    "I landed on my butt with a dull thud."

    pro "Ugh… seriously, Yumi, you're making a mistake!"
    sis "I’m not worried."

    #sfx door opening
    "Yumi swung the door to the garage open and surveyed the damage."

    sis "..."

    "Her mouth became a solid, stone line. Disappointment flashed across her face in an instant."
    "This is the part where S⛧Tan cleaned it up for me, right…?"
    "Or mere mortals cannot hope to comprehend the chaos?"
    #sfx door closing
    "Yumi waited a second, then gingerly closed the door and glared at me."

    sis "So… What exactly were you doing in there?"
    pro "Would you believe me if I said I was practicing practical movie effects?"
    sis "No."
    pro "Then… {i}not{/i} that."
    sis "I can't {b}believe{/b} you!. The one thing Mom and Dad specifically said {i}not{/i} to do was practice that occult shit in the house!"
    sis "Would've been better if you just... found some corn field to do it in, I dunno!"
    pro "No, Yumi, you don't understand, I actually--"
    sis "And it's an absolute {i}mess{/i} in there! I'm not cleaning that up! And you were about to {i}leave{/i} it for Mom and Dad to find!?"
    pro "It's not like that, I have to find--"
    sis "I'm gonna call them right now and tell them you've been channeling bygone spirits again!"
    pro "W-Wait, please--"
    sis "Ooh, wait 'til they hear about this! You're gonna be in {b}{i}so{/b}{/i} much trouble!"

    #yumi exit stage right 

    "Before I could reply, she’d already turned around and stomped off in a rage."
    "This is bad. This is really {b}really{/b} bad!"
    "Scrambling to my feet, I give chase."

    scene hallway2

    "Somehow, I manage to keep up with her - though I nearly tripped on my cape in the process." "Blasted thing just gets in the way most of the time…"
    "She was already at the door to her room! I had to stop her, here and now!"
    pro "Yumi, please, you gotta let me explain! It's not what you think!"
    sis "You're not going to change my mind with your usual crap, Makoto!"
    sis "'Ooh, the stars demanded it be so; ooooh, the chaotic miasma must be realigned!' It's all stupid, stupid crap!"
    pro "I don't sound like that!"
    #sfx door opening
    "She slowly turned the knob…!"
    sis "You just need to think really hard about what's important, Makoto. Just grow up and-and…"
    sis "...Wha?"

    "Yumi went quiet; her face went pale."
    "She just stood there, watching…"

    #enter beepy stage left

    bp "...Hullo."
    sis "..."
    pro "Beepy…? What are you doing in my sister's room?"
    bp "I was trying to find yours, but... this, uh, wasn't it."
    bp "Smelled too much like flowers and lavender. Think you could point me the right way?"
    pro "It’s… It’s to the right, over there."
    bp "Sweet, thanks."

    #exit beepy stage right

    "Without another word, she brushed past my sister and I. Yumi remained silent until..."

    sis "What was that…?"
    pro "Belphegor of Sloth. She prefers to be called Beepy, though."
    sis "How… How did it-- how did she get here?"
    pro "From, uh, that summoning ritual in the garage?"
    sis "...Huh."

    sis "This is just a weird dream, right, Makoto?"
    pro "...Yeah, let's call it that for now."
    sis "Okay… I-I'll just… rest my head for a bit."
    pro "Yeah, you… you don't look so good."
    pro "Forget about that whole, uh, calling Mom and Dad thing too, yeah…"

    #sis slowly exit stage left
    sis "Oh… okay… Good night, Makoto…"

    #sfx door closing
    "She shambled back into her room, almost like a zombie. She closed the door behind her."

    pro "Haaah…"

    "I released a breath I didn't realize I was holding."
    "Alright. Time to do some damage control. I wouldn't make for a demon lord if I couldn't lay down the law in my own home."
    "Beepy’s wandering around like she owns the place… that will {i}definitely{/i} cause problems."
    "Steeling myself, I turn myself towards the door to my room and march forward."
