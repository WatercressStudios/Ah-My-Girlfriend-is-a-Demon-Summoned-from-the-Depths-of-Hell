    "This wasn't quite the finale I had hoped for."
    "Stuck in this stuffy classroom for an hour, an arm's reach from Misaki."
    "Usually, in times like this, Beepy would get bored and make some sardonic remark. She didn't tag along this time, though."
    "A teacher was at the front, kicking back in his seat. I recognize him from science."
    "He was the sort that tried to be friends with every student. It could've been perceived as cute, if it wasn't so annoying."
    tea "Mm… can't say I'm particularly surprised."
    "He was shaking his head as he said this. I wanted to cut him down to size. I didn't need his pity nor his condescension." 
    "Instead, I remained silent. After all the hullabaloo on the rooftop, my energy is utterly drained."
    "Glancing aside to Misaki, she seems similarly quiet - the most quiet I've seen her in some time."
    "Like a barely restrained animal, she glares daggers at the councillor. Up front, and from his throne of power, he's largely unphased."
    tea "Well… I hope you kids don't mind if I duck out to get a coffee. Don't tell on me to the principal, okay?"
    tea "Haha… ha…"
    "He laughed, trying to lighten the mood. There was no response."
    tea "Well, you guys just stay put and… think about what you done."
    tea "...It's not like I want to be here anymore than you guys do, so…" 
    "Excusing himself, he moved to exit the classroom."

    "As the door closed behind him. Silence hung over the room."

    "Misaki's leaning back in her seat, arms folded. She seemed content to wait out the clock."
    "...It was alien seeing her so composed like this. Usually, she was fuming at any little thing."
    "Maybe she was just as exhausted as I was. She must've been."

    pro "Odd that it's just the two of us in for detention."
    riv "...Quite. Perhaps the others are satisfied to be vapid conformists."
    riv "Or they play favourites with the athletic clubs. I cannot fathom it."
    pro "Why don't they allow students on the roof? I never understood that."
    pro "Everything's fenced off, it's completely safe. Far as I know, no one's {i}died{/i} up there."
    riv "Mmhm. Nice view too. And from such a high vantage, you can be closer to God."
    pro "Huh. I didn't know you were the religious sort."
    #misaki uncertain
    riv "I… I'm not, really, it just… sounded cooler in my head."
    pro "...I see."

    "Silence fell over the classroom once again."
    "I couldn't stand it. Something didn't feel right about this."
    "The silence was grating. Perhaps smalltalk was the domain of simpler minds, but…"
    "...I would rather have that in their air than nothing at all."

    pro "So, uh… Countess--"
    riv "Misaki's fine. I'm not in the mood right now, Makoto."
    pro "A-Ah, it… it's like that?"

    "This was interesting. Misaki wasn't usually the sort to drop character. Her nerves were as steel."
    "Her eyes drifted over to survey me. Eventually, she let out a sigh."

    riv "I… I'm annoyed."
    pro "'Annoyed?’ I'm sorry?"
    riv "No, not with you - well, maybe a bit, but… feh."
    #misaki contemplating
    riv "..."

    "Her eyebrows furrowed as she sunk deeper into her chair. She was contemplating something."
    "...Choosing her words carefully. Now {i}that{/i} was a cause for concern."

    riv "Makoto? You feel like… maybe this whole thing was just a waste of time?"
    pro "...What?"
    riv "I-I mean, like… with this whole craziness about summoning demons."
    riv "I felt like… like maybe if I could attain some kind of power like that, it… it'd help me get ahead."
    riv "You had the same thought, didn't you?"
    pro "Yeah, you're right."
    pro "And then when we put all the cards on the table, none of it… really amounted to anything."
    pro "It was the same as if we met."
    riv "...I suppose our servants ended up being layabouts, huh."
    pro "Heh. True, very true."
    pro "...Still, though. S_Tan, she… she seemed to care about you a lot."
    riv "Feh. Right, 'power of love' and all that nonsense."
    riv "...She's endearing, in her own saccharine way."
    riv "And I suppose your Beepy was quite attached to you as well."
    pro "Yeah, she… she wanted me to make sure I was taking care of myself properly."
    pro "Heh. I don't think she ever really cared about the demonic showdown."
    riv "...Mm…"

    "Misaki stirred in her seat."

    riv "...Frankly, I'm not in the mood for a rematch. We put everything on the table."
    riv "Determining a winner such as that would be…"
    pro "...It'd be repeating the same process, expecting different results."
    riv "E-Exactly."
    riv "...Makoto, I… I was wondering. Why did you want to start an Occult Club?"
    pro "..."

    "Why did I originally turn in a form? That was a question I hadn't thought about in some time."
    "I paused, trying to recollect, to come up with a suitably poetic recounting."
    "...But nothing came to mind. Nothing that would satisfy the Countess."

    pro "I was bored, I guess."
    riv "{i}...Bored?{/i}"
    pro "Yeah. I mean… why would you climb a mountain? Because it's there."
    pro "I figure, just to cast a line, and see if I hooked any catches. Perhaps a club would be the beginning of a following."
    pro "And from there, my influence would grow. From the lordship of the school, to across town, then across Japan, and the world itself."
    pro "...And then I would extend my reach to beyond the stars. Ufufu~"
    #misaki sly smirk
    riv "Ah, of course you would be looking for followers. You must be terribly lonely, not having any friends."
    pro "Y-You don't have to be so blunt about it."
    riv "Ohoho~"

    "Misaki was grinning cheekily, laughing her annoying laugh like it was some kind of catchphrase."
    "It's not like she had friends either…" 

    riv "Ah… that's something of a relief though."
    riv "...When I had found out, I thought you were just trying to one-up me as rivals are wont to do."
    riv "...Perhaps I gave you too much credit."
    pro "Waaait a second. When we exhausted our mana pools, you said it yourself."
    pro "We're evenly matched. Perhaps you're a bit too prideful."
    riv "...Th-That was… I…"
    #misaki pout
    riv "...Hmph. Fine, I guess I said those things. I guess."
    pro "Heh."
    riv "Oh don't look so self-assured! If S_Tan had pulled her weight, this'd be settled by now!"
    pro "If she pulled her weight, huh…?" 

    "I leaned back in my seat. I thought about things a bit."

    pro "Heh. Maybe they had other priorities."
    riv "What are you babbling on about?"
    pro "There was something Beepy was always nagging me about."
    pro "About taking the magic talk down a notch, acting normal, making friends."
    riv "Hmph. How preachy."
    pro "Heh. I was a bad listener too, but I… I think she had a point."
    pro "Did S_Tan ever talk to you about this sort of stuff?"
    riv "...Sometimes. A lot of it sounded out of some schlocky anime. I didn't pay much attention."
    riv "Power of love or some such. That it has the power to bridge any conflict."
    #misaki sad
    riv "...She's been nice, though, I… I don't hate her."

    "Misaki must've grown attached to S_Tan. Usually it takes a lot of goading to get such high praise from her."

    pro "I guess they've been… they've been looking out for us more than we thought."
    riv "Guess so…" 
    riv "...Heh. All for the sake of a pointless… dumb duel."
    riv "The futility of it all… it almost makes you want to laugh, doesn't it?"
    pro "I guess it is a little funny."
    pro "Though… I'm not sure if it was all pointless, in the end."
    pro "We ended up learning a bit more about each other."
    riv "...When you put it like that, you make it sound as if they had a plan all along."
    pro "Haha… wouldn't surprise me."

    "Though both of us were able to chat so casually, without pretense or masquerade, there was a question that hung in the back of my mind."

    pro "...Misaki, I had an idea."
    pro "Would it be an issue if we… we submitted a joint application for an Occult Club?"
    riv "Hm…"

    "Oh no. She was seriously considering it."

    riv "Well. You {i}are{/i} my equal as a magus - though your attire is novice magecraft at best."
    riv "I suppose if we… combined our powers… then there would be nothing standing in our way."
    pro "To glory and prestige, I assume."
    riv "S-Something like that."

    "Sitting up a little straighter, she looked a little more jazzed up for this idea."

    riv "Honestly, that's not the worst idea you've ever had, Makoto!"
    riv "With my brains and your brawn, we could rule this sinful realm."
    pro "...Am I {i}really{/i} the brawn here? It was my idea."
    riv "Hm, true. A two-headed dragon would be a more appropriate moniker." 
    riv "Shoot, usually you end up signing contracts for this sort of agreement."
    pro "Do you… wanna shake on it instead?"
    #misaki concern
    riv "...Hmmm…"

    "Her eyes lowered to my outstretched hand."

    riv "...A verbal agreement would've sufficed, but… ah, whatever."

    #misaki smirk

    "She clasped it firmly. Her eyes lit up with excitement."

    riv "The pact is sealed. We shall combine our resources, and bring about a new age, Sebastian."
    pro "...I wouldn't have it any other way, Countess."
    riv "Ohoho~!"
    pro "Ufufu~!"
    tea "H-Hey, you kids better not be enjoying yourselves in there!"
    riv "Crap!"
