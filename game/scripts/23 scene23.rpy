    "My eyes flutter open to greet the new day."
    "All that anxiety and loneliness from last night almost feels unreal."
    "So many jumbled thoughts flowing in all at once… I’m not even sure what day it is right now."
    "...I cast a glance towards my calendar, following the days that are marked off until I reach the present."
    "It’s Friday."
    "The day of the fated battle."
    "The day I face Misaki and put an end to our feud."
    "I wish I could be more excited - but after last night,  it’s hard for me to even think about it."
    "And I know that all of my training will be for naught if my mind is clouded…"
    "...God, what am I even saying? Who cares about that!?"
    "This doesn’t have anything to do with that; this is about making things right."
    "Before I can even think about what to do with Misaki… I have to talk with Beepy."
    "I need to tell her that she was right."
    "Not just her, but everyone else, too. They deserve an apology just as much."
    "With my mind made up, I freshen up and head out of my room."

    "Just as I thought, everyone is already awake and seated at the table."
    "There’s an awkward silence hanging in the air. Usually things would be a little more lively, but everyone is content to sit there this morning."
    "Even Yumi is there with everyone, eating in silence - but she notices me and greets me as I take my seat."

    #enter Yumi stage left

    sis "Mornin’."
    pro "Ah… morning."

    "Yumi’s the only one who says anything to me. Lucy, Mami, and Bubble give me a polite wave, but start staring at me awkwardly."
    "And Beepy… Beepy won’t even look at me right now."
    "I can feel guilt welling up in the pit of my stomach… Maybe it’s already too late."
    "But just when I think talking won’t do any good now, Yumi addresses me."

    #show Yumi serious

    sis "So… I take it you have something to say to everyone?"
    pro "Oh… y-yeah, I do."

    #exit Yumi stage left

    "So even she knows what’s been happening… Well, I guess it was hard not to notice."
    "I take a deep breath… and bare my soul before everyone present."

    pro "I, um… I just want to apologize for my mood the past several days."
    pro "None of you were trying to waste my time; all you were doing was trying to help me, and I really do appreciate that."
    pro "I was just… so caught up in my own self-absorbed persona that I wasn’t thinking about anything other than being an ‘all-powerful warlord’ or whatever."
    pro "I wasn’t listening to any of you at all… and I just brushed off all you had to say."
    pro "None of you deserve that - not Lucy, not Mami, not Bubble…"
    pro "And especially not Beepy."
    pro "I’m sorry I’ve been such a… big idiot."

    "I can’t even look anyone in the eye while I was talking. My eyes remain glued to the table."
    "I’m so convinced that they won’t accept my apology that I can’t bear to bring my head up."
    "...And yet, when I finally do muster up the courage to look at everyone else…"

    "I see… smiling faces."
    "Did… did my words get through to them?"

    bp "Well, look at that. Even a self-proclaimed demon lord is capable of humility, huh?"
    lu "I-I’m really glad you came forward like this! I-I’d hate to think we’re all just being a bother to you…"
    lu "Seems like we tend to lose sight of things like that a lot, huh…?"
    mm "That part about you being an idiot was totally true, though."
    bb "Hehe, yeah! Super true!"

    #show Beepy tired

    bp "Not now, you two… you’re spoiling the moment."

    "I can’t even believe what I’m seeing right now."
    "Everyone’s so… accepting of my apology. I thought they wouldn’t accept it at all, but here they are, smiling like nothing ever happened."

    pro "S-So you… you forgive me?"
    bb "Of course we forgive you, Big Bro!"
    mm "It’s not like we’ve known each other for that long anyways, so…"
    mm "Don’t worry about it. We’re cool Makoto."
    lu "I-I couldn’t bear to turn down such a heartfelt apology from you, Makoto!"

    pro "Beepy…?"
    bp "Mmm…"

    #show Beepy smiling

    bp "Sure, I’ll accept your apology. I could tell you were being genuine and true to yourself just now."
    bp "Besides… it’s too much trouble to hold a grudge for that long."
    pro "Everyone…"
    pro "...Thank you."

    #hide Beepy

    "I give everyone the first honest smile I have given in who knows how long."
    "I forgot what it felt like to be surrounded by people who care about me and want me to succeed."
    "All this time, I thought I was afraid of not being special - or of anyone not giving me the time of day because I’m just another person in a sea of billions."
    "In all honesty, I was running away from real life and adopting a persona to overcome this dreadful monotony."
    "But all I succeeded in doing was driving people away anyways, ensuring no one wanted anything to do with me and leaving me all by myself."
    "Now that I’m with people who want me to be a better person, I can finally see what I’ve been missing this whole time."
    "I don’t need special powers or archaic knowledge to make myself happy."
    "I just need… friends."

    mm "Hey, save some for us, you glutton!"
    bb "Who’re you callin’ a glutton, you greedy pig!?"

    #hide twins and Yumi

    "We can’t help but all share a laugh as we start pulling things together for breakfast."
    "This must be what an honest, enjoyable meal with friends and family is like…"
    "It’s crazy and hectic, but… in a good way."

    #show Beepy

    pro "By the way, Beepy, kind of a weird question, but…"

    #show Beepy smiling

    bp "I was sleeping with Yumi."

    sis "Wh-What’s the problem!? There’s nothing wrong with two girls sleeping together, right?"
    sis "Besides, it… i-it was kinda nice..."
    bp "Hm? What’re you getting all red for?"
    sis "Ah--!"

    #show Yumi annoyed

    sis "Th-That’s none of your concern! Don’t think I’m getting comfortable having you around!"
    sis "And that goes double for the rest of you, too! You oughta start pulling your weight more instead of freeloading!"

    lu "Uwah… I-I’m sorry, honestly!"

    #show Beepy tired

    bp "Well… so much for the cozy atmosphere."

    bp "So… what now?"
    bp "It’s a new day, and we could all use some relaxing after last night."
    pro "Well… I still need to go to school."
    bp "Oh. Right. Almost forgot."
    pro "Also… there’s something I still have to do."

    #show twins

    bb "Huh? What is it, Big Bro?"
    pro "It’s something that only I can take care of. Something I can only do by myself."
    pro "I won’t ask any of you to shoulder the burden. This time, I’ll handle it on my own."
    bp "I’m coming with you, you know."
    pro "No… I can’t let you, Beepy."
    mm "What the hell’s your problem!? You spend all that time sucking up to us just so you can abandon us again!?"
    pro "N-No, of course not! I just…"
    pro "I don’t want to involve anyone else. This is strictly between me… and her."
    pro "So you don’t have to worry. I’ll be back before you even know it."
    pro "I give you my word as Sebasti-- ...no, as Makoto Takaya."

    #show Lucy

    bp "Eh. Do what you gotta do, I guess."
    bb "I hope you come back soon, Makoto~!"

    lu "P-Please… just come back safely…"

    "They’re all… waiting for me to come back…"
    "Of course. That’s what friends are for. They’ll just have to trust that I’ll make it back in one piece…"
    "Just like how I have to trust in everything they’ve taught me."

    pro "I’ll see you all later."

    "Saying my farewells to the first honest friends I’ve had in awhile…"
