    "Several minutes pass without either of us saying a word to each other."
    "I’m concentrating harder than ever on my notes, while Beepy stares out the window, bored out of her mind."
    "And before I know it…"

    #sfx bell ring

    "*RING!*"
    "The bell sounds, signaling the end of study hall."
    "I let out a sigh of relief, having managed to cram in all I can in the nick of time."
    "I’m about to pack up and head to the next class when Beepy approaches me."

    #enter Beepy stage left

    bp "Well, I think I’ll head home."
    pro "Wait, you’re going already?"

    #show Beepy confused

    bp "Uh… yeah?"
    bp "You don’t want me around anyways, so it’s fine, right?"
    pro "I-I never said anything like that…"
    bp "Trust me, you were probably thinking something like…"

    #show Beepy wide-eyed

    bp "’Away with you, oh slothy being of slothiness, lest ye get blasted into a million pieces by my death beam!’’"

    #show Beepy tired

    bp "Besides, the bed at home is comfier than your backpack."
    pro "...You’re only realizing that {i}now{/i}?"
    bp "Yeah, I don’t want to admit it, but… Satan was right."
    bp "I’m starting to get cramps all over…"

    "So you’ll worry about that, but not the strain on my back? Your priorities sure are something else…"

    bp "You sure you don’t need me for anything else, though?"
    pro "Oh, uh… N-Not really, I was just surprised you were taking off so soon."
    pro "You can head back if you want, though."
    bp "‘Kay. Guess I’ll see you when you get home…"
    bp "...Assuming I remember where your house is… Eh, it’ll probably be fine."

    #exit Beepy stage right

    "With a lazy wave, Beepy slowly trudges out of the classroom."
    "I can’t help but watch her leave… Is it really alright for me to let her go on her way?"
    "...Well, whatever. She can probably make her way back just fine, assuming I don’t find her sleeping in a trash can or anything."
    "The day has yet to end for me, however, and now is the time for me to finish my business in this dimensional pocket."
    "For my next class, we take a look at scriptures retrieved from the ancient past in World History."
    "There’s hardly anything about how the conjurors of the past would carry out their rituals; it would be more exciting to learn about than some dumb crusades."
    "Of course, it would {i}also{/i} be too much for their fragile, mortal minds to comprehend…"
    "And finally, the last class to wrap up the day is Science - a completely worthless one by all accounts."
    "I had suggested we study the history and practice of alchemy instead, but the teacher grew more stone-faced than a Nurikabe."
    "So now, I simply study in earnest, as I would in any other course."
    "No one bothers to approach me, but this is fine. I don’t have much interest in interacting with these lower lifeforms anyway."
    "But while I’m diligently studying, my mind keeps wandering back to yesterday…"

    "Honestly, it’s still hard for me to believe any of that actually happened."
    "Summoning Satan in the flesh is a feat in and of itself, but learning I could get a free demon for a month…"
    "Well, that was an offer that I just couldn’t say no to."

    #show CG of Beepy’s intro, sepia tone

    "...Until she ended up sticking me with Beepy."
    "For someone who’s supposed to be an all-powerful demon, she hasn’t done much besides eat and sleep the whole time."
    "She’s kind of a nag, to boot - like Yumi, but even more intrusive."
    "I had thought that would be the full extent of my troubles, but…"

    #show CG of Misaki’s intro, sepia tone

    "But imagine my surprise when my rival also managed to summon a demon - and she actually got Satan!"
    "That must have been another method of hers to rile me up - and I fell for it all too easily."
    "And now, we must settle the score with a climactic battle in just two Earth days."
    "I can feel the overwhelming odds stacked against me. With Satan in her corner, I don’t think I stand a chance."
    "But I have to try. No demon lord would admit defeat so easily, and I cannot let her steal that which is rightfully mine."
    "I must double my efforts and train harder than ever before! By the time my training is complete, they’ll be begging for mercy on judgement day!"

    #sfx ring

    "*RING!*"
    "The final bell rings, signalling the end of the school day."
    "With no other commitments, I start to make my way back home."
