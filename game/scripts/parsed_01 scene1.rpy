    "Tuesday. The most accursed day of the week."
    "The foolish, unenlightened masses regularly assume that Monday is the worst out their lot -  but Tuesday is where the true despair begins."
    "They convince themselves that things won't be so bad, but as soon as Tuesday comes, they realize there is no escape."
    "They have already become slaves to another mundane moment of existence - and it is too late to break away when they finally realize their mistake."
    "And the only thing they can do to keep themselves from succumbing to insanity is to bear the weight of their burden until the week is over."
    "Yes, Tuesday is the one day of the week where human anguish and misery reach their absolute peak…"
    "...Which makes things perfect for me."
    "But who am I, you ask?"
