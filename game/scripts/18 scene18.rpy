    "Here again..."

    scene schoolhallway

    "..."
    "I try to walk through the halls, pushing past the mundanes walking in the opposite direction and pushing through those who seem to think it wise to stand right in the middle - even though others are trying to travel.."
    "I fail to understand these people. Why are they so ignorant as to inconvenience everybody else for what seems like no benefit?"
    "To tell the truth, there are more things I don’t quite understand."
    "What they do, what their joys are."
    "I understand that they choose to bond themselves with the people they call their ‘friends,’ I understand that they choose to enamour themselves with passions similar to my own, but I am unsure of why."
    "I am sure that I will eventually find some sort of divine understanding…"
    "Until then, I suppose that this will be a mystery almost like the Voynich Manuscript."
    "And until then, I suppose that I won't know what makes the people around me tick."

    bp "So… Do the people here just stand around all lunchtime and block other people?"
    pro "Essentially."
    bp "Oh well. I guess that means you get to relax before you eat."

    "She winks and gives a smirk to me as the uninvited memories flood their way into my mind." "I’ve come from Math."
    "More specifically, it’s a subject where life is quantified through numbers; unfortunately, it is also taught by the seventh most powerful witch of the Metaworld."
    "Mrs. Yakubovich…"
    "The woman with the all-seeing eye. The woman with the bat's ears. The woman who can hear any conversation and smite the culprit if necessary."
    "The woman who will absolutely stop at nothing to make sure her students know exactly what they need to. Bells, lunchtimes - even the very fabric of time itself - didn't matter if Mrs. Yakubovich had not completed her lesson." 
    "Personally, I fear her."
    "If I could be honest, I think everyone does."
    "But she is not what matters right now. All I need to do here is take my lunch and begone, like the witches of Salem."
    "{i}Especially{/i} given where I need to attain it."

    scene cafeteria

    "The school cafeteria."
    "Disorder, uncleanliness, and horrible food reign supreme here, hanging over its subjects like a miasma. Few survived a trip here with their sanity in-tact, and those that did found it hard to desensitize themselves to the pain."
    "Of course, being a regular customer and being… mentally {i}stronger{/i} than the rest, I had adjusted to this place."
    "Well, I had {i}mostly{/i} adjusted, at the very least. I headed to the front of the cafeteria, where the initial line had mostly dissipated."

    bp "...Forget your room. {i}This{/i} is where I need to do some spring cleaning."

    "Don't, Beepy. Only suffering exists down that path."
    "..."
    "Eventually, I get my daily ration of glop. After this, I move again, heading towards the other end of the serving table."
    "One thing that my school seems to do different to most others is have a… sort of concession stand. If a mortal soul were to make a deal, they could sacrifice their money in exchange for treats."
    "Some would even get addicted to the feel or the taste."
    "Powerful as I am, I am one of them."
    "I walk in front of the stand, looking at what there is to offer. Donuts. Cakes. Muffins…"
    "Slightly larger muffins…"
    "I make my choice fairly quickly. I walk forward, get my wallet out, and prepare to let the woman in front of me know who exactly she was dealing with."

    pro "Hey, uh, can I have an, um… blueberry muffin?"
    vs "Sure."

    "She had bent like a… bendy… thing. She was so easily willing to give me my muffin."
    "This would be easy."

    vs "Alright, that's $4.00."

    "Not a hefty price to pay. I reach into my wallet, pull out my coins, and…"
    "$2.00."
    "I freeze. Stop. Look down at the coins, counting and counting and recounting and recounting to make sure I have the right number."
    "I don't."
    "I don't have enough money."
    "And I look at the stand and I see that there is nothing else I can possibly buy with the meager amount I have. There is nothing I can do.”
    “How could this possibly happen to me!?”
    “I will have to suffer through the glob and the slime and I will not be able to reward myself for persevering."
    "I don't know what to do. I don't know how to tell the person here I don't have enough money without them getting annoyed."
    "I--"

    riv "M-Make that two."

    "Almost as if the bearer of bad news had come late, {i}she{/i} popped up right next to me, pink and pretty wallet in her hand."
    "Of {i}course{/i} things had to get worse."

    vs "So… two blueberry muffins?"
    riv "Y-yeah. One for me, one for h-him."

    "One… for me?"
    "This almost feels like a joke."
    "This definitely feels like humiliation." 
    "Still, I suppose that I cannot complain..."

    vs "Alright, that's $8."
    riv "H-Here."

    "She hands the money. The woman at the concession stand gives a smile - toothy, likely fake - as she hands the two muffins to her."
    "There is a moment where she hangs there, staring at both bags. After it ends, she moves and gives me one with a shove."

    riv "There."

    "Silence."

    riv "Now we're even."
    pro "Um, thanks?"

    "She walks away as my throat barely even chokes the words out, not looking back as she disappears into the crowd."
    "What was that about?"
    "I am unsure. She mentioned something about this making us ‘even,' but I'm not sure why."
    "Could it be the help at the supermarket?"
    "...Thinking about it, signs point to yes."
    "But couldn't she have taken advantage of that? Couldn't she have acted as if she did not owe me anything, and used my generosity to her advantage?"
    "She should have."
    "I would have."
    "But I suppose I cannot complain. She had elected to help me out here, as payment for me helping her out back then. What went around came around."
    "I suppose I can be happy at that."
    "But still, why? Why did I accept it?"
    "I don't know."
    "I am sure that it is not a hard question, I am sure that I will eventually find some sort of divine  understanding about this topic…"
    "...But until then, I suppose that this will be a mystery."
    "Almost like the Voynich Manuscript."
    "And until then, I suppose that I won't know what makes that girl - my rival - tick."
