    "Riding in the car always seemed so thrilling when I was younger."

    "I’m sure that if you had asked my younger self why I liked the feeling so much, he would have been able to give you an answer."
    "Maybe not one that was {i}detailed,{/i} but an answer nonetheless. Something about how they were {i}fast{/i} or {i}cool,{/i} or how the feeling was {i}thrilling,{/i} or something like that."
    "I don’t know, really."
    "To be honest, I don’t even really {i}want{/i} to know. Past me made terrible mistakes. {i}Lord{/i} knew that I wouldn’t want to revisit any of {i}those{/i} memories."

    "My sister calls from inside the car. It was like a sort of demonic aura: I could sense her frustration, even though I couldn’t see her right now.."
    "And although they seemed to be members of the Sins, it was as if my sister was a demonic force more powerful than any of them could ever hope to be."

    "I was impressed. I was also afraid."
    "So I decided to take slow steps across the back of the car to its left side - briefly hoping that my sister would not start it and accidently take me from this mortal plane." 
    "The back door is open. Lucifer is standing by it, looking inside."

    "I look into the back seat as well. Beelzebub is sitting on the opposite side of the door, still squabbling with her sister."
    "The seat in front of me - the one next to the door - was empty. Pristine. Comfortable, even."
    "Less could be said about the spot in the middle."
    "It was slightly raised compared to the surrounding seats. It was also of a different colour than the others."
    "The cause - a grape juice incident from long ago; the memories haunt me to this day."
    "The floor below was bumped up, making it so that anyone of a human size could not sit properly, for reasons that no mortal man would ever be allowed to know."
    "The middle seat."
    "A circle of Hell that not even Dante would have the courage to enter."
    "I couldn’t help but loathe the times where I was damned to that cruel fate."
    "Turning oneself into a human pretzel is truly an interesting skill - but doing it for a long time is painful at best."
