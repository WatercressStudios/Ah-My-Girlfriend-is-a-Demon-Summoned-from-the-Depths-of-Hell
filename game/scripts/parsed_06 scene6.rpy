    "Sure enough, Yumi was waiting for me."
    "I thought her time-out was supposed to relax her, but instead it just wound her up even tighter."

    voice "C-6-3.mp3" #Makoto (Reece Bridger)
    pro "What girl? This is all a dream, right?"
    
    voice "C-6-4.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "Erghh! She {i}just{/i} walked by me! She's pillaging our kitchen right now!"
    
    voice "C-6-5.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "Where'd you even find her!? Is it some sleazy dating site for edgy little creeps like you?"
    
    voice "C-6-6.mp3" #Makoto (Reece Bridger)
    pro "Hey now, that's going a little far! I'm of average height for someone my age!"

    voice "C-6-10.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "She's not, like, {i}actually{/i} a demon of sloth, right? Did you pay her to play out your sick-minded roleplay or something?"
    
    voice "C-6-11.mp3" #Makoto (Reece Bridger)
    pro "I-It's not a roleplay! She's actually a demon!"

    sis "...I might have to believe you."
    
    voice "C-6-14.mp3" #Makoto (Reece Bridger)
    pro "...Really?"

    "This was weird. My sister had always been skeptical of my dark magic."
    "Usually she'd just dismiss it as some kind of dorky LARPing thing; she never understood before, so why start now?"

    voice "C-6-15.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "...I mean, I considered other explanations, but I really can't believe them either."

    pro "Th-Thanks for the vote of confidence, sis."
    
    voice "C-6-20.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "Heheh. I call it like it is~"

    "Stupid Yumi. Always teasing me like this."
    "The worst part is that she possesses a demon lord’s blood inside of her. By sorceror law, I can't bring harm to her."
    "She is a lucky, utterly oblivious sort. I curse that fact frequently."
    "...She also has a good foot on me, so if I tried… she could probably throw me pretty far."

    voice "C-6-21.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "Yeah, there's no way you could land a girl as cute as her."

    sis "J-Joking aside… this demon business is hard to swallow, Makoto."
    
    voice "C-6-25.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)

    sis "Oi… Sticking to that story, huh…"
    
    voice "C-6-28.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "I can't believe you. I thought Mom and Dad explicitly told you that bringing evil beings and spirits into our house was off-limits!"

    pro "What makes you think Beepy's evil, though?"
    
    voice "C-6-30.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "...Excuse me? You keep calling her a demon, right?"
    
    voice "C-6-31.mp3" #Makoto (Reece Bridger)
    pro "Well, yeah, she is, but that doesn't make her evil by default."
    
    voice "C-6-32.mp3" #Makoto (Reece Bridger)
    pro "You're coming off as a little judgmental there, Yumi."
    
    voice "C-6-33.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "You brat…!"

    "Yumi grimaced visibly, and I could immediately tell I had the upper hand in this battle of ours."

    voice "C-6-34.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "Alright, let's just assume she's {i}actually{/i} a demon, I guess. I don't believe it, but for the sake of argument..."

    voice "C-6-38.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
    sis "She's just visiting, right? She should probably go back to her place soon; it's getting dark and I need to cook."

    pro "Well, uh, I don't think that would work."

    voice "C-6-41.mp3" #Yumi (Kaito)
