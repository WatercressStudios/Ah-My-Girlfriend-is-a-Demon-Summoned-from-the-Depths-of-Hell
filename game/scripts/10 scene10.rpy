    "The first step of my training is to survive another arduous day in this circle of Hell."
    "It seems I am to temporarily set aside any plans for world domination and endure hours upon hours of monotonous lectures and assignments."
    "The task itself is not difficult; all that is required of me is that I pay attention and take notes, as any diligent lord of darkness should."
    "But the hard part lies in the aggravating tedium that comes from listening to every lecture."
    "It’s enough to have my soul leave my body - and the subjects they cover aren’t even enjoyable in the first place."
    "The first class is English, in which we are subjected to an archaic dialect that is still being used by most of the known world."
    "Not even the denizens of Hell should sit through a class that teaches a broken and absurd language."
    "Next comes Mathematics, where we exhaust every possible avenue to quantify life itself through numbers."
    "It must be some kind of cruel cosmic joke that such a complex course comes right after English."
    "After that comes the moment of relief: a brief lunch period followed by study hall."
    "It is here that I study material covered in class for future assignments and tests."
    "But the thought of settling things with my rival still won’t leave my head…"
    "I’m so lost in concentration that I don’t even notice Beepy resting her head on my desk."

    bp "Hey, Makoto."
    pro "{b}Daagh!{/b}"

    "I reflexively jump out of my seat as soon as Beepy speaks to me."
    "But all my sudden outburst does is attract an annoyed stare from every mortal in the room."
    "Their eyes pierce me like daggers… Best to not make more of a scene."

    pro "A-Ahahaha, s-sorry~!"

    "I sheepishly return to my seat while the other students return to their studying."
    "The embarrassment on my face is palpable; it burns hotter than the hottest flames in the Underworld."
    "I’ll have to teach my impertinent servant what happens when you interrupt a hard-working demon overlord."

    bp "Chill, dude... I just wanted to ask you something."
    pro "Oh, {i}now{/i} you want to ask me something?"
    pro "All you’ve been doing is sleeping through every class, so why the change of heart?"
    bp "I already know all the material covered… so there’s no point in staying up anyway."

    #show Beepy quizzical

    bp "...Is this a bad time? You look pretty stressed out…"
    pro "N-No, I just…"

    "I wouldn’t have been so stressed out if you hadn’t scared me half to death and embarrassed me in front of the entire student body!"
    "Honestly, I’m surprised you even want to talk, considering you didn’t answer any of my questions last time."
    "But, if it’ll get you to get off my back for awhile…"

    pro "*Sigh* Fine. What is it?"
    bp "Well… I was just wondering…"
    bp "What’s the deal with that Misaki girl?"
    pro "You mean my most hated rival, Countess Elizabeth, the Everlasting--"

    #show Beepy annoyed

    bp "No. I mean Misaki."
    bp "Can you please just say a name that’s normal for once?"

    "I knew it was a bad idea to indulge her."
    "Regardless, she deserves to know just as much as I do - even if she won’t be of much use in our upcoming duel."

    pro "W-Well, if you must know… she has been interfering with me ever since the start of the school year."
    pro "I had an idea that was going to establish my place among the others, but before I knew it…"

    co "I must say, not only am I surprised to see anyone submit an application for an ‘Occult Club’ of all things…"
    co "But to have {i}two{/i} students submitting a similar application… Well, it’s quite a surprise."
    co "So then… what seems to be the problem here?"
    pro "It’s obvious, sir. I had arranged for my devilish machinations to supplant themselves within this facility..."
    pro "That is, until this witch came along and sought to challenge my birthright."

    riv "Th-That’s a lie! Don’t believe his honeyed words! He’s a devious trickster at heart!"
    riv "I had long ago planned for my own kingdom to become reality, when this {i}worthless troglodyte{/i} stole the opportunity from beneath me!"
    pro "Who are you calling a troglodyte!?"
    riv "Shall I call you a buffoon instead!?"
    co "Alright, that’s enough!"
    co "Honestly, the way you kids talk makes me think this place is becoming Hell on Earth…"
    co "Listen, we have no way of knowing who submitted which application…"
    co "So the best advice I can give you two is to talk things out."
    co "Find out your strengths and weaknesses. Figure out who can cover what responsibilities."
    co "And hopefully, you two can come to a better understanding of who’s more suited to run it."

    riv "Obviously it’s {i}me{/i} whose suited to run this club, not you!"
    riv "Your lack of knowledge and presence in the astral plane is an embarrassment to dark mages everywhere!"
    pro "Is that so!? Will all the knowledge in the world help you when Armageddon knocks at your door!?"
    pro "This club requires one who can bend the universe to his will and obliterate his enemies without a second thought!"
    pro "It does not need the leadership of a pathetic stargazer such as yourself!"
    riv "You {i}insolent fool{/i}! Do you wish to suffer eternal damnation beyond the end of time itself!?"
    pro "A fate like that is {i}beyond{/i} preferable to surrendering my destiny to the likes of you!"

    #show Misaki annoyed, eyes closed

    riv "Humph! Stubbornness like that won’t help you realize the error of your ways."

    #show Misaki confident

    riv "Perhaps it would be better to show you how easily I can bend the tapestry of life to my will."
    pro "What exactly are you implying, you audacious fraud!?"
    riv "You may claim you know all there is to know about the dark arts…"
    riv "But until you can prove your mastery to me, you have no right to run this club!"
    riv "You have exactly 72 Earth hours. Don’t disappoint me."
    pro "A-Are you serious!?"
    pro "...W-Well, fine then!"
    pro "I’ll cast a spell so powerful and terrifying, you’ll have no choice but to kneel before me!"
    riv "Don’t count on it, for it is {i}you{/i} who will recognize your rightful place at my side soon enough!"

    bp "That’s it? That’s more petty than I thought."
    bp "Though, I guess I’m not surprised… People your age tend to do stuff like this for really stupid reasons."
    pro "I was so close to defeating her and establishing my own Inner Hell… but she’s one step ahead of me!"
    pro "Damn her… She’s not going down without a fight, that’s for sure."

    "Beepy’s eyes roam the classroom in disinterest, until she finally looks back to me."

    pro "Huh…?"

    #show Beepy smiling

    bp "I think you like each other."
    pro "{b}What!?{/b}"

    pro "What are you {i}saying!?{/i} There is {i}no way{/i} I could {i}ever{/i} get along with her!"
    pro "Have you even {i}seen{/i} how we interact!? We argue more than Agni and Rudra!"
    bp "Looks more like flirting to me, honestly."

    #show Beepy annoyed

    bp "Jeez. Is this how you react when someone gives you attention?"
    bp "At least you have a friend at all, man. I’d say that’s a good thing, since you don’t even talk to anyone else."
    pro "Wh-Who needs friends? Such mundane concepts are beneath a master of accursed magic and--"
    bp "{i}Ugggggh{/i}... you’re impossible."

    #show Beepy concerned

    bp "All I’m saying is maybe if you acted like less of a weirdo, people would be more willing to talk with you."
    bp "I mean, I’m no social butterfly either, but… it’s kinda sad that you’re not bothering to interact with anyone else."
    bp "Just drop that whole ‘dark lord’ schtick and be normal for a change."
    pro "...Then everyone would really ignore me."
    pro "There’s nothing even remotely special about the real me. My connection to the shadow realm is all I have."
    pro "Without that, I’m just a plain and boring high-schooler, same as anyone else. No one would give someone like me the time of day."
    pro "I would much rather be known as a lord of thunder than just another face in the yearbook."
    pro "And if that means I have to go without making ‘friends,’ then so be it."
    pro "Now if you don’t mind, I’d like to get back to my studies."

    "I cut off conversation with Beepy and resume taking notes."
    "The silence should help me concentrate, but my mind keeps wandering back to our discussion from mere moments ago."
    "All that talk did was remind me how worthless I am."
    "Without my title, all I am is a pathetic, worthless being who will be forgotten as soon as I pass on to the next life."
    "How could anyone accept such mediocrity?"
    "Well, I won’t simply fade into the ether. I’ll use my dark powers to change the world and etch my name into history!"
    "I am Sebastian Wolfgang IV, and no one will stop me from claiming my rightful place as--"
