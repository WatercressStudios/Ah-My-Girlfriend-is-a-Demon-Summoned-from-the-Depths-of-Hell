    pro "So, you're telling me…"
    lu "Yeah?"
    pro "That you want me to be the next subject of your art project?"
    lu "I-uhh, I mean, if you don't mind…"

    pro "Of course I mind! I want nothing to do with your worldly trifles. Quite honestly, it's a waste of my time."

    pro "This so called 'art' won't help me end this miserable world, will it? No?"

    lu "N-No…"

    "I can't believe she's chosen to approach me about this. I'd never accept a proposition such as this… unless it were a painting fit for a dark lord."
    "Not to mention, I cannot risk what otherworldly powers she'll use."

    "What if she were to steal my soul and put it into such a painting? I couldn't live a lifetime in a frame. I can't achieve my goals in a state like that, and I'm sure it would be utterly boring!"

    "No, I must refuse."

    "Before I have a chance to continue my rant, she tears up."

    lu "I only want to draw you; I promise it won't take long and I'll be out of your hair and it won't mean anything and I won't bother you ever ag--"

    pro "Stop stop stop!"

    "Shaking my head and frowning, I cut her off."

    "I sigh exasperatedly; I don't want to deal with the blowback from a situation like this. If the others were to hear that I made Lucy cry, I'd never hear the end of it - or worse…"

    "Unfortunately, I have no other choice but to participate."

    "What a waste of time."

    "And, as much as I hate to say it, I pity her - which is odd, considering she's the Demon Lord of Pride. These demons really are nothing like the versions in the books."

    "Sometimes I wonder if they're playing a big trick on me - a ruse only to prove a point, to embarrass me for having the audacity to summon them… One of them."

    "I'm not quite sure when this became a house party, but here I am."

    "I wonder, will they grant me any power over this mortal coil or are they only here to ridicule me?"

    "I'll suffer through these trials and tribulations if it means getting what I rightfully deserve."

    pro "Fine, I'll do it. Let me get prepared, I must don some more… appropriate attire."

    lu "Appropriate? No, what you're wearing is fine, I promise!"

    pro "If you are to draw me, I want the art to show my true self. So, I need my cloak."

    lu "Actually, if you wouldn't mind, I really want to sketch without it."

    lu "Clothing only masks your true form - we don't need any of that roleplaying stuff..."

    "...Wait."

    "Does she want to draw me… nude?"

    "Nononoooo, that's neeever going to happen."

    pro "I-uh, I-I don't think that's uhh… a good idea! No!"

    lu "Oh, don't be so afraid! That cosplay stuff is kind of beneath me anyways…"

    pro "I'm not going to participate if you expect me to get naked!"

    "Wait. Cosplay stuff?"

    lu "Wait. Naked?"

    "I instinctively look away. Being naked in front of a girl, hell - in front of anyone for that matter?"

    "No, that's something I cannot ever let myself indulge in."

    "Grabbing ahold of myself, I clear my throat."

    pro "Ahem, I'm sorry Lucy, but either I wear clothing or I'll have to respectfully decline."

    "She waves her hands and takes more than a few steps back, covering her face."

    lu "No! I mean, regular {i}people{/i} clothes! I don't want to see you naked, dear God no!"

    lu "Gross…"

    pro "Hey!"

    lu "I just want to draw you as you are, exposed and unobstructed…"

    lu "No, that doesn't sound right. Like, without that ridiculous facade you put on. Just you being you, okay?"

    pro "Hey! T--"

    lu "Shushshushshush."

    "Lucy walks up and puts a finger over my mouth, forcing me to quiet down."

    lu "Just… sit on the bed, okay?"

    "Frowning, I resign myself to this fate, sit down, and cross my arms."

    "Lucy sits in a chair just opposite, pulling out her sketchpad and beginning her work."

    lu "I'm going to start with a sketch of you - still life style - and then I'll work on a painting from that, okay?"

    pro "Mm. Yeah, that's fine."

    lu "Awesome."

    "She gives me a slight smile before continuing."

    "The room grows silent - awkwardly so. Only her pencil breaks through the velvety veil, making slight scritching sounds as she gently glides it along the paper. Other than that, there is nothing."

    "It's… odd. She made all of this talk about 'exposing your true self,' but here I am, doing nothing."

    "Sitting in a room, alone with her."

    "Quietly..."

    "I hope this isn't what world domination feels like."

    "Because if so, then what's the point?"

    "If there's nothing after the end of the world - if there's nothing to enjoy - then what's the point?"

    "I suppose there's the age old saying, 'the journey is more than the destination,’ but I'm a realist. The destination is {i}infinitely{/i} more important."

    "Actually, I'll, uh, decide when I get there."

    "Shaking off these intrusive thoughts, I look back to Lucy."

    "She has a determined expression on her face - a nice break from the norm. She's normally so anxious - shy, even - but right now? She looks like she's actually having fun."

    "She looks like she belongs in this spot, right here."

    "I wonder if that's how I look when I'm practicing my dark arts?"

    lu "Mm! Almost done~! Thanks for sitting so still; you're a natural, or something…"

    lu "You know, your stance says a lot about you. You look so… sad?"

    pro "Sad?"

    lu "Y-Yeah. I mean, I don't want to offend, but... You know, you're always frowning and you cross your arms and legs like you want to close yourself off from the world and I think that's really sad and…"

    lu "I guess it makes it easier to draw you, since your expression isn't exactly a complicated one. The fact that you hide your hands makes it much easier as well - man, hands are hard to draw! Anyways…"

    "Sad? No! I'm the great and all powerful Wolfgang IV! Just one look from my eyes, and all shall run in terror! They attempt to dodge fate, but it'll come to all in the end…"

    "Sad, huh?"

    pro "Are you sure?"

    lu "Yeah, hands are awful."

    pro "N-No, not that."

    "Lucy looks at me, perplexed. Then, it hits her."

    lu "Yeah… I'm sure."

    lu "Wanna see?"

    pro "Yes, of course."

    "She turns her sketchpad towards me and holds it up over her chest."

    "Wow."

    "That's actually very good, no matter how hard as it is to see me in there. It's obviously designed to be painted over or alongside."

    "She's right."

    "I do look quite sad. My body language closed off, my gaze down, my mouth in a slight frown; it doesn't look like I'm a bright and triumphant dark lord at all."

    "She must've seen my reaction, as she continues speaking."

    lu "It speaks volumes, seeing you like this. You look so… forlorn? About everything. No confidence, no {i}pride{/i}."

    lu "Which is weird, you seem so prideful when you're cosplaying! But, in the end, that's just a painting."

    lu "A caricature painted over the true you."

    lu "You should try to take pride in not only your character, but in you yourself."

    lu "You may not see it, but you have redeeming qualities. Take pride in who you are and what you show off to the world. You don't need to hide within yourself forever."

    lu "Sure, sometimes you can get lost in pride - as I find myself doing sometimes - but it's bad to have a lack of it too. It's all about balance, yeah?"

    lu "And… Uhh, y-you'd be a whole lot cuter if you did so…"

    "Blushing, she goes back to work, as if she'd said nothing."

    "{i}Cuter?{/i}"

    "Implying I'm cute at all?"

    "I'm not cute! I'm a dark…"

    "I really don't have the energy for that right now."

    "I just want to sleep."

    "Suddenly sapped of the energy I had going into this, I just sort of sit there until she finishes."

    "I try not to think about anything, focusing on the scritches from her pencil, her determined expression, and the blush that lingers on her cheeks."

    "It doesn't take long for her to finish."

    "She shows it to me once more, frowning."

    lu "I'm sorry it turned out so poor. I wish I was a better artist!"
    lu "I didn't get the shading right, the eyes look disproportionately large compared to your head, and the folds on your clothing don't look realistic at all, and don't get me started o--"

    pro "I like it."

    lu "Exactly! It's awf-- What?"

    pro "It's really good, Lucy. If you hadn't have said anything, I wouldn't have noticed the 'mistakes,' and many of them I can't notice because they aren't there."

    pro "There's potential, to be certain."

    lu "I-uhh-- I, thanks."

    "She takes the drawing and turns from me, holding it close to her chest and crossing her arms over it."

    "She closes her eyes, then turns to me."

    lu "I'll keep this for now. I'll finish painting it later, okay? I promise!"

    pro "Okay. I'll see it then."

    "Lucy goes to leave, opening the door."

    lu "Thanks for letting me draw you, Makoto. Really."

    "Then, she leaves."
