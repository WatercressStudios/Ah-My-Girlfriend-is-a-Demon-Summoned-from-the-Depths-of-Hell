    "Eventually, we each go our separate ways, Misaki and Satan exit the supermarket early, to the sadness of the two demons and the indifference of myself."
    "Once we had everything we needed, we - {i}I{/i} paid and left, the voices of the two demons squabbling behind me."

    "I see my sister - the demon Lucifer alongside her - at the car, and I push the trolley across the parking lot."

    "A lot of masters, probably, but not me. I give the trolley to my sister, nod as she takes it, and walk to where the other three are."

    "Now that the sun is nearly gone from the sky, there are almost no mortals inhabiting this parking lot. That is… convenient. Preferable, even. If I had to bump into someone, if I had to talk to someone who had no idea what the depths of this world were, I..."
    "...Wouldn't know what to do. And {i}God{/i} knew what would happen if the Demon Lord Sebastian Wolfgang IV was caught off guard."
    "But now was not the time for unlikely hypotheticals. I had a necklace I needed to find. I turned a corner and saw a new part of the parking lot. Cars. Abandoned trolleys. Litter."
    "Eventually, I see a glint under one of the dumpsters. I walk forward, slightly curious. Is that what I'm looking for? Is that the thing Mammon covets so dearly? I'm not entirely sure."
    "Still, I suppose there is no harm in looking. I walk to the dumpster, pick the… chain thing up, and--"

    voice "C-16-32.mp3" #Mami 
    mm "You found it. {i}You found it~!{/i}"

    "In front of me is Mammon, bent over slightly. She is clutching, caressing the necklace, She isn't looking at me, nor the two demons coming up from behind her; she is only looking at the object in her hands."
    "Her {i}precious{/i} possession, as expected from the lord of greed."

    voice "C-16-42.mp3" #Mami 
    mm "But I know that she sees herself as worse than others as well. I know she's jealous of other people. I know she wants to be on their level. I know that she expects what she makes to be the best, I know she wants others to care about her things."

    voice "C-16-45.mp3" #Mami
