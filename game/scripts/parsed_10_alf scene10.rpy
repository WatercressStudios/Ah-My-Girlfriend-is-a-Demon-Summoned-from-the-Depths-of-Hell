    "And with the bell's toll, the day begins in earnest."
    "The first step of my training is to survive another arduous day in this circle of Hell."
    "It seems I am to temporarily set aside any plans for world domination and endure hours upon hours of monotonous lectures and assignments."
    "The task itself is not difficult; all that is required of me is that I pay attention and take notes, as any diligent lord of darkness should."
    "But the hard part lies in the aggravating tedium that comes from listening to every lecture."
    "It’s enough to have my soul leave my body - and the subjects they cover aren’t even enjoyable in the first place."
    "The first class is English, in which we are subjected to an archaic dialect that is still being used by most of the known world."
    "Not even the denizens of Hell should sit through a class that teaches a broken and absurd language."
    "Next comes Mathematics, where we exhaust every possible avenue to quantify life itself through numbers."
    "It must be some kind of cruel cosmic joke that such a complex course comes right after English."
    "After that comes the moment of relief: a brief lunch period followed by study hall."
    "It is here that I study material covered in class for future assignments and tests."
    "But the thought of settling things with my rival still won’t leave my head…"
    "I’m so lost in concentration that I don’t even notice Beepy resting her head on my desk."
