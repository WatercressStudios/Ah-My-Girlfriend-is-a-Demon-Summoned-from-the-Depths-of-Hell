    "When you’re a demon overlord who has powers beyond human comprehension, you expect fervent cooperation from anyone and everyone."
    "Surely, one would not think to question my motivations when their existence could be erased at the drop of a hat."
    "But every once in a while, you encounter a loathsome individual who refuses to bend their knee, opting instead to challenge your almighty providence."
    "And unfortunately for me… my sister is one of those people."
