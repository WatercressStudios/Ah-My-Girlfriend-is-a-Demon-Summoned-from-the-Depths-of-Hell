    "Finally, my last-minute cramming is finished."
    "I allow myself a good, long stretch and take a moment to admire my handiwork."
    "Not even the greatest earthly philosophers with all of their combined knowledge could have accomplished in their entire lifetimes what I just did in mere hours."
    "I feel unstoppable! Nothing can possibly wrest me away from my dark triumphs!"
    "Except, of course, for the sudden onset of exhaustion..."

    "I glance over to my alarm clock to see how many fleeting hours have passed."
    "It’s 11:20 now. I should have been ready for bed 20 minutes ago!"

    "Cleaning myself of impurities in the bathroom, I determined that it was finally time for bed."
    "Time once again to drift away into that dark void and slumber until the next day."
    "I can at least sleep knowing that after all my hard work, I’m prepared for what lies ahead tomorrow."
    "With no other obligations to attend to, I drape myself in blankets and close my eyes, then drift off to sleep."

    "For some unexplainable reason, my eyes open once again."
    "Why am I unable to sleep? Has the Sandman decided not to sprinkle his dust over me this evening?"
    "No… There has to be an explanation for why I’m feeling this way."

    "But Beepy is not there."
    "She hasn’t snuck under my sheets and curled up beside me like she always has."
    "It’s more than just an answer I’ve found - it’s a realization that’s hit me like a truck."
    "I’ve driven Beepy away… and now I’m all by myself. Here, in my room, with no one else to share this bed with."
    "For the first time in my life, I feel… abandoned. Unwanted."

    "I turn over on my back, staring up at my bedroom ceiling and trying to make sense of it all."
    "I think back to the time I spent with Beepy. Even though I thought of her as a pain and a useless demon…"
    "She was trying to help me this whole time."
    "Beepy was trying to make me into a better person."
    "And I… all I did was yell at her. Call her a nuisance."
    "I was so obsessed with just trying to learn any dark arts I could - to gain an upper hand over Misaki - that I lost sight of what she was trying to teach me."
    "Now she’s left me alone as a result… and I feel that loss more than ever."
    "Even when I didn’t want her in the same bed as me, her presence alone is preferable to the intense loneliness I’m feeling."
    "And it wasn’t just her, either; Mami telling me to hold on to what matters to me, Lucy encouraging me to take pride in myself - even Bubble teaching me how to provide for myself and for other people."
    "They were all giving me the knowledge and wisdom I needed to make it through life."
    "But all I had for their help was scorn."
    "I turned a blind eye to their advice, believing their words to just be a waste of time."
    "And it’s only now, after I’ve turned my back on them, do I realize all of this."
    "They must think I want nothing to do with them now."
    "Or worse, Beepy must not want anything to do with me anymore…"

    pro "What have I been doing all this time…?"

    "I try to find the words to describe this pit of despair I’m in… but nothing comes from it."
    "My mind is completely blank - too exhausted to think anymore."
    "All I know for certain is that… this doesn’t feel right."
    "It isn’t right for me to treat their help like a waste of time, and it’s not right for them to feel they’ve wasted their energy on me."
    "I was the one who caused this rift - and now, more than I ever, do I realize that this is no way to live."
    "I have to be the one to mend these bridges. I have to come clean and own up to what I’ve done."
    "I’m not even sure if they’ll forgive me… but I still have to make things right."
    "Not for the sake of some petty duel, but for the demons who’ve helped me…"
    "And also for my sake."
    "Makoto Takaya’s sake."
    "With my mind made up, I begin to close my eyes…"
