    "It’s another ordinary day for the students of Akumahou High School."
    "Yet another long, tiresome day of sitting through endless lectures; the students accept their fate and absorb knowledge like flies."
    "There are those who look forward to the oncoming weekend, but have their excitement dulled by the ever-present monotony."
    "And by the time they get to enjoy the weekend, they find that they must return back to school and the cycle begins anew."
    "Yet on this particular day - at this particular moment in time - my enthusiasm cannot be quelled."
    "The day has finally come -  the moment I’ve been waiting for ever since that fateful encounter two days ago…"

    "My final showdown with Misaki Tendou, better known as Countess Elizabeth, the Everlasting Matriarch of the Forgotten Realms."
    "She has been a thorn in my side ever since she challenged my authority, remaining one step ahead of me wherever I go."
    "She even went as far as to perform the same demon summoning ritual … The nerve of her."
    "But she won’t be able to get the upper hand on me any longer."
    "I’m prepared now, more than ever, to show her who deserves to lead the Occult Club."
    "It’s almost sad to know that this may very well be our last showdown… but that’s why it’s all the more important to make this a fight worth remembering."
