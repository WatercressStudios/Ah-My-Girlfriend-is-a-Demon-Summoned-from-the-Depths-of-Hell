    "This is no dream. This is all real. Satan actually heeded my call and left me in the care of this…"
    "Well, I’m not sure if Beepy even counts as a terrifying demon. She hasn’t even done anything yet."
    "But still, a demon should know their place in the presence of a demon lord."
    "Using all the strength I can muster, I manage to wrestle my arm away - but the force of my pushing ends up sending her off the bed."
