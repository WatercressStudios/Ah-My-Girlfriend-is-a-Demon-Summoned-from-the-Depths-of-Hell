    "Time passes quickly. Surprisingly, Beepy and Yumi get along with each other - even better than it initially seemed."
    "Though, I’m not thrilled that their relationship hinges on their mutual exasperation…"
    "When we're done eating, we all take seats in the dining room."
    sis "Alright, so to recap…"
    sis "Makoto performed some creepo summoning ritual…"
    pro "Yes."
    sis "...And actually managed to summon a demon."
    bp "Seems so."
    sis "...And you're still sticking with that story? That you're his 'familiar' or whatever?"
    bp "I mean… have you seen my tail? Do you wanna touch my horns?"
    sis "I-I don't think that's appropriate conduct for a first introduction."
    bp "It'd answer your questions, though..."
    pro "None of this is fake, Yumi. How long is it going to be until you accept reality?"
    bp "You probably think I'm some old man in a mask, trying to scare you off the property."
    sis "No! I-It's not like that; I just… it's taking a little to wrap my head around this whole mess, hehe~!"
    "Yumi was acting very strange around Beepy, but I can’t quite put my finger on it..."
    "Perhaps she was still awed by a true demon’s presence? ...I suppose any mortal would react as such."
    sis "W-Well… I guess while you're here, you should stay. You can take the sofa if you like."
    bp "Ah, sounds great. Thanks a bunch~"
    sis "And Makoto…"

    "As she turned to face me, her face twisted into a stern glare."

    sis "You're gonna work on fixing this whole summoning mess, right?"
    pro "What? But I need her to--"
    sis "I'm talking about the crazy summoning crap in the garage! You need to clean that up before Mom and Dad find out!"
    sis "Seriously, Makoto… Summoning demons while they're on their business trip; if they catch wind of it, you'll get in so much trouble…"

    "...If I were grounded indefinitely, it {i}would{/i} stall my plans for world domination."

    pro "I-I'll figure something out. Could you just keep quiet about all this for now?"
    sis "Hmph. I don't owe you anything, but… whatever."
    sis "Just remember: you brought her into this world, so you have to be the one to take her out!"
    bp "You, uh... Couldn't you word that any other way…?"
    pro "Understood. I'll find a way to reverse the process."
    bp "Thaaaat doesn't sound much better…" 

    "After that exchange, silence hung awkwardly over all of us."
    "It seems I had unwittingly formed a pact with my sister. I would have to resolve this situation in a timely manner."
    "My progenitors will be absent for some time, so..."
    "I'll have more than enough time to come up with a contingency plan."

    sis "Makoto and I both have school tomorrow… We should think of getting to bed."
    sis "Hey Beepy, do you want me to grab you a blanket? It gets chilly overnight!"
    bp "Nah, I can curl up just about anywhere. Thanks for the offer, though."
    sis "Heh, no problem! Just-- Just want to make sure you're comfortable while you're here, haha~!"

    "Why is my sister giggling like a lunatic?"

    pro "Perhaps her fragile mind has already given in? I’m sure it cannot hope to comprehend the forces at play here..."
    sis "Huh? What'd you say?"
    pro "Nothing, nothing at all! I, too, must depart to my bed chambers."
    pro "...For tomorrow will be the beginning. The beginning of the end. Ufufu~"
    bp "Aw… I just got here, though…"
    sis "He's just doing his monologuing thing again - and most of it's gibberish."
    pro "Ha. Soon you will come to realize that everything leading up to this point… it is all connected."

    #sfx something like a swoosh??

    "With a dramatic flourish of my cape, I vanish like an ebony breeze caught by… by an errant breeze."

    #beepy and yumi delivering line at same time
    #look into UI trick for this
    bp "...Weirdo."

    scene hallway2
    "With no one following me, I make a beeline to my room."

    scene makotoroom
    pro "Finally, some privacy…"
    "Despite everything, my sanctum remains unsullied. The opportunity arises for me to reflect on events and chart a course for what lies ahead."
    "What transpired at home so far has only been a distraction from my ultimate goal."
    pro "Yes! When daybreak casts its warm glow across the land, everything that I have worked up to… will be laid bare."
    pro "I should get to bed that much sooner, then. I grow weary of today and yearn for tomorrow - the dawn of a new day."
    pro "...The dawn of a new era, I should say. Ufufu~"

    #sfx something like a swoosh??
    "Chuckling to myself, I quickly toss my cape, my cloak, and my-- N-No, not my undergarments."
    "Even for someone with as black a soul as mine, that would be entirely too lewd."

    pro "Yes… tomorrow, I shall exact my revenge upon that cursed being."
    pro "The false idol that claimed ultimate authority… I shall strike her down and claim both her throne and her title."
    pro "Yeah, that's gonna be real… {i}neato…{/i}"

    #sfx flopping into bed

    "Fatigue overcomes me as I collapse onto the bed."
    "Beepy’s faint, lingering scent hits me as my head presses against the pillow."
    "Like lavender and jasmine. Gentle and relaxing."
    "It's a nice feeling. Disarming, even. I feel myself getting drowsy…"

    scene black
    "Safe in my own domain, I drift to sleep…" 
    "..."
    "... …"
    "... … …"
    "...?"
    scene makotoroomdark
    "It's still dark. Yet I'm stirred awake."
    "Usually I'm a heavy sleeper. Even the excitement of the coming day wouldn't keep me from getting an even eight hours of sleep."
    "But I had a feeling - no, it was more than that."
    "Why does it smell so nice in here? Like… {i}really{/i} nice. It's a smell that could relax you so thoroughly, so completely…"
    "So much so that you may never wish to get up again - but a feeling of paranoia overrode it."
    "As my senses clicked into place, I could feel something more."
    "It was close… it was very, {i}very{/i} close."
    bp "...Nn…" 
    pro "Huh...!?"
    "Dread washing over me, I turned my head to the left…"
    "My eyes had already adjusted to the dark. I could make out the outline…"

    #cg beepy sleeping next to protag
    #protag delivery should be panicked whispering

    pro "...Beepy!?"
    bp "...Mornin’..."
    pro "Wh-What are you doing here!? How did you get in here!?"
    bp "Used the door…"
    bp "...S'comfy 'n' warm... "

    "She was curled up like a cat! And her body was pressing against mine! It was… she was so warm…!"
    pro "Th-This bed can't fit two people! What are you thinking!?"
    bp "Eh… made it work.."
    bp "Could you keep it down…? People are tryin' to sleep…"
    pro "Get out. {b}Get out!{/b}"
    bp "Mmm… naaah. Way better than the sofa."
    pro "Rgh, grr…" 
    #sfx bedsprings creaking
    "I tried to shove her off the bed, but she's way too heavy."
    "...Augh! She's scooching even closer!"
    bp "Go to bed Makotooo… it'll be fine…"
    pro "Wha--!"
    "Her tail playfully settled across my chest! She’s toying with me!"
    "Her hands rhythmically tensed and loosed against the bed sheets. It seemed like an odd habit, but… it looked relaxing."
    "The smell of lavender and jasmine wafted up once more. It was difficult to stay mad at this ungodly hour."
    "Though the bed was made for one, both of us almost fit. My eyes fluttering, I felt my resolve wither away."
    pro "Grr… just one night. No more."
    bp "Won't happen again~"

    "...Why did it sound like she was taunting me just then? I’ve got a bad feeling about this."
    #scene black
    "The situation being largely out of my control, I decided to live and let live. Drifting back to sleep as best I could…"
    "For a while, I could feel the rhythmic rise and fall of her chest as she slept. For whatever reason, the sensation was calming."
    "...Yumi absolutely {i}cannot{/i} find out about this. Under no circumstance!"
    "..."
    "... …"
    "... … …"
