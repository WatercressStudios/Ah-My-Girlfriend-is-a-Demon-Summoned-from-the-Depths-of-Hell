    "After what feels like hours, I’m finally finished with Lucy’s art session."
    "Now would be the time for me to relax - yet for some reason, I am unable to."
    "There’s less than a day remaining until the showdown between me and Countess Elizabeth, a battle to decide our fates."
    "But I haven’t gotten a single second of training from Beepy or her friends yet."
    "Meanwhile, my rival has Satan in her corner - who is no doubt teaching her all sorts of arcane incantations as we speak."
    "What if I fall behind? What if she ends up overpowering me and I lose the chance to become that which I’ve always desired!?"
    "There’s no way it can end like that… I have to start my training right away so I can catch up and unlock ancient abilities that no one has ever--"

    bb "Makoto, Makoto, Makoto, Makoto!"

    "My train of thought is interrupted by Bubble, who runs up and bounces excitedly around me."
    "She has so much energy for such a small little thing… Perhaps I should learn how to siphon some of that energy for myself?"
    "But regardless, a nuisance like this is the last thing I need right now."

    pro "Agh- H-Hey, settle down! What is it!?"

    #show Bubble smiling

    bb "Hey! Hey! Didja know? Didja know?"
    bb "Didja know what time it is~?"
    pro "What…?"

    "I cast a curious glance down to my watch, just to be sure."

    pro "Uh… it’s 4:37. What of it?"
    bb "Nihihihi~! That’s right! And that means…"

    #show Bubble excited

    bb "It’s finally time!"

    "Wait a minute, she couldn’t possibly mean…"

    pro "You mean… it’s time to learn some magic at long last?"
    bb "Uh-huh! Uh-huh! I’m gonna teach you some super awesome magic today!"

    "Finally… I thought this opportunity would never come!"
    "I can feel my adrenaline rising by the second as I clench my fists together and let a wicked smile overtake my face."

    pro "Hahaha~ Well, whatever are we waiting for, dear Beelzebub?"
    pro "Let us begin drawing upon the deepest, darkest secrets of this world so that I may step ever closer to realizing my ambitions!"
    bb "Hehe, okie-dokie~! We’re gonna learn some awesome magic today! Are ya ready?"
    pro "Yeah!"
    bb "Are ya {i}really ready{/i}?"
    pro "{b}Yeah!{/b}"
    bb "{b}Okay!{/b} The super awesome secret magical skill we’re going to learn today iiiiis…"

    "Bubble drags me into the kitchen and presents the stove like how Mother Harlot presents her seven-headed beast."

    bb "{b}Cooking~!{/b}"
    bb "{b}Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Woo-hoo~!{/b}"
    pro "..."

    "I don’t think I’ve ever been more disappointed in my entire life."
    "All that hype and buildup… for something as mundane as cooking!?"
    "I had to sit as still as a gargoyle for hours while Lucy draws my portrait, and {i}this{/i} is what I’m learning now!?"
    "If she were a court jester and I were king, I’d have had her beheaded in seconds!"

    pro "A-Are you kidding me? What good is {i}that{/i} going to do me!?"

    #show Bubble annoyed

    bb "Well, aren’t you just a no-fun Mr. Party Pooper! Cooking is one of the most important special abilities you can possibly learn!"
    bb "You can’t be a super powerful demon lord on an empty stomach, right!?"
    pro "Well obviously, but--"

    #show Bubble smiling

    bb "Then just relax! I’ll teach how to make a super awesome meal in no time!"
    bb "Besides, we gotta put the food we got yesterday to use somehow! Don’t tell me you bought all of it without even thinking about it!"

    "This infuriating little imp is trying to get out of teaching me what I need to know… Doesn’t she know what I need right now isn’t a cooking lesson!?"
    "I’m starting to wonder if Beepy has been serious at all in trying to get these guys to help me out…"
    "...You know what? Fine. Whatever."
    "I’ve been distracted left and right all week, what’s one more distraction for the magic circle?"

    pro "Fine. I’ll look over what we have…"

    #show Bubble serious

    bb "Nonononono! That’s not how we’ll be doing things!"
    bb "In the catering business, the chef always listens to the customer first to understand what they want before they make any meal!"

    #show Bubble smiling

    bb "Soooo, I’ll tell you what I want first, and {i}then{/i} you can make it!"
    pro "I-I mean, sure, but… I was just gonna see what food we have to work with."
    bb "Oh, don’t worry about that! I memorized every single ingredient in the house, so I already know what you guys have!"

    "That doesn’t ease my worries at all. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if she already has a plan to eat us out of house and home…"

    #show Bubble serious, eyes closed

    bb "Now, let’s see… What do I wanna eat today…?"

    #show Bubble smiling, eyes closed

    bb "Time to eat! Time to eat! Whatever shall I eat~?"
    bb "Whole grains or vegetables~? Milk, fruit, or meat~?"
    bb "Whichever one I pick will be so yummy and so sweet~!"
    bb "But what I want the most today just cannot be beat~!"

    "I can’t believe I am burning daylight hours for this."

    #show Bubble smiling

    bb "I want… Lasagna!"
    pro "...That’s it? All that singing and {i}lasagna{/i} is what you want!?"
    bb "Well, yeah! It’s what my tummy decided, after all!"

    "Did your ‘tummy’ also decide to waste my time - not only with this cooking nonsense, but with that stupid ceremony too?"

    bb "Anyways! Now you know what I want! So now you can make some food!"
    pro "H-Hold on a second! I dunno how to cook! I can barely even get toast right!"
    bb "Really? Wow, guess this lesson will be good for something, huh?"

    #show Bubble confused

    bb "Though, you can’t really eat lasagna for breakfast, can you…?"

    #show Bubble smiling

    bb "Oh well, never stopped me before! And you shouldn’t let it stop you, either, Makoto~!"

    "What’s to stop me from walking away right now?"

    bb "Alright, enough blabbity blab! Let’s make some {b}food~!{/b}"

    "And so, rather begrudgingly, I start making lasagna with Bubble."
    "Turns out we have more than enough ingredients, and Bubble is there to guide me through every step in preparing the dish."
    "She’s actually rather competent when it comes to preparing a meal - a far cry from her usual childish self."
    "In no time, we manage to combine all the ingredients together and place it in the oven, heating it at a temperature to rival that of Muspelheim."
    "And soon enough… it is done."

    #scene livingroom

    "I can smell every inch of melted cheese, savory meat, and assorted veggies from the pan."
    "Even I have to admit… it looks devilishly delightful."
    "And out of the corner of my eye, I can see Bubble taking in every square inch, her eyes as big as… well, dinner plates."

    #enter Bubble stage left, show Bubble drooling

    bb "{i}Oooooooooooooooh~!{/i} It smells so goooooooood~!"
    pro "H-Hey, careful, it’s still pretty hot."

    "While I set the lasagna onto the stove, my sister happens to walk in on us."

    #enter Yumi stage right, show Yumi surprised

    sis "Whoa… Is that lasagna?"

    "She inspects my handiwork top to bottom, and a smile appears on her face. She must like what she sees."

    #show Yumi smiling

    sis "It looks {i}and{/i} smells really good… Did you make this, Makoto?"
    pro "Oh, uh… I-I-I guess I did, haha~…"

    #show Bubble smiling

    bb "Yup yup! I showed him how to make it, and he did all the hard work!"
    sis "Man, and I was running late on dinner and everything… But I never thought you could make anything like this."
    sis "Thanks, Makoto."
    pro "Huh? Oh, d-don’t mention it…"

    "Receiving praise from my sister… I’m not sure if I should feel honored or embarrassed."
    "Eventually, the rest of the demons in the household gather to admire my handiwork."

    bp "Mmm, lasagna… I was wondering where that smell was coming from."
    lu "I-It looks really good! The texture and the balance are completely intact, a-and there’s not a single piece that feels out of place!"
    mm "Hell yeah! I can’t wait to dig into this!"

    #exit Beepy, Lucy, and Mami stage left

    "All this attention for just one meal… It’s getting a little too much for me."
    "I don’t know why me making a meal is worthy of praise. That’s just like giving Hermes a pat on the back for his natural speed."
    "But having people admire my work for what feels like the first time in my life… I don’t know how to describe it."

    #enter Bubble scene left

    bb "It feels nice, doesn’t it?"
    pro "Eh? What does?"
    bb "That feeling of accomplishment when you work really, really hard on a good meal and everyone loves it!"
    bb "To know that all that time you spent making the food was worth it… because now, you have something really yummy for you and your family to share."
    bb "That’s what it means to provide for yourself and for others."
    bb "I think you should feel proud of yourself, Makoto; making something like this provides people with what they need to get through life."
    bb "Without that lasagna, who knows what would’ve happened? We could’ve starved or something!"
    pro "Y-Yeah, I guess so…"
    bb "Making food isn’t easy; it takes time and effort, and you have to get everything just right."
    bb "But when you finish making a meal, you feel {i}really{/i} good about it, and I think that’s something you should feel when making anything!"
    bb "So don’t be afraid to enjoy whatever you made. You were the one who made it, after all!"

    "...She does have a point."
    "Watching the others admire the lasagna I painstakingly made; it’s hard not to feel some satisfaction for that."
    "Like I was able to do something that really meant something and reap the benefits…"

    #show Bubble surprised

    bb "Oh yeah! I almost forgot!"

    #exit Bubble scene left

    "In a haste, Bubble squeezes her way past the other demons to cut out a piece of lasagna… then presents it to Mami."

    #enter Bubble scene right, enter Mami scene left

    bb "First piece is for you!"

    #show Mami surprised

    mm "Huh? Me?"

    #show Bubble sad

    bb "I know it probably doesn’t mean much, but… this is my apology for the other day."
    bb "S-Sorry I caused you so much trouble…"
    mm "Bubble…"

    "I didn’t even know demons were capable of regret."
    "I can hear the sincerity in her words - and evidently Mami does too, as she cracks an understanding smile."

    mm "Don’t worry about it."

    #show Bubble smiling

    bb "Thanks, Mami."

    "Seeing the two of them make up… is honestly pretty touching."
    "When I first met them, I thought the two of them were just a pair of annoying brats… In fact, I’m sure they still can be."
    "But knowing what they’ve had to say to me… they’re actually more mature than they appear to be."
    "Yet there’s one thing that’s bothering me…"

    pro "How come you’re sharing food at all? I would assume a demon of gluttony would keep all the food it can find for--"

    #show Mami annoyed

    mm "She {i}just said{/i} it was an apology! Weren’t you listening, idiot!?"

    #show Bubble annoyed

    bb "Yeah! Weren’t you paying attention, dummy!?"

    "...I take it back. They’re brats through and through."

    #scene black

    "We all gather at the table to enjoy the delicious lasagna."
    "I do feel proud about learning how to cook something, but…"
    "In the end, I ended up not learning anything for tomorrow. I haven’t learned any dark arts of any kind in the past three days."
    "Knowing that, my mood turns sour in almost a heartbeat."
    "All I’ve been doing is spinning my wheels while my rival gathers more and more power…"
    "And all these demons have been doing is wasting my time, pulling me in different directions and not accomplishing anything important!"
    "What the hell have I been doing all this time!?"
    "I don’t feel any closer to attaining ultimate power - not through shopping, nor through being a model, and {i}especially{/i} not through cooking."
    "Now there’s no more time left… I feel wholly unprepared for the final battle tomorrow."
    "I suppose the only thing left to do is for me to study up on my own. I should have done this sort of thing from the beginning…."
    "Without another word to anyone, I finish up my plate and head straight for my room."
