    scene rooftop1
    "Through the winding hallways and the mountainous staircases, I had finally reached the rooftop."
    "The wind cut against my face. On all sides, I was surrounded by towering chain-link fences."
    "I could feel swirling arcane forces, caged within like animals. How appropriate."

    riv "You're late! For a moment, I suspected you had fled like the cowardly lion you are!"

    riv "It is time to demonstrate their full potential! We shall be as their bloodthirsty leaders, destined to clash forevermore."
    st "Or until a victor is decided! Proper pacing is key to an enjoyable experience!"
    st "...Though, I guess it doesn't really stop a lot of shonen shows from going on and on, and onnn…"
    bp "...I don't recall agreeing to mortal combat. You know how hard it is to clean blood stains?"
    pro "Uhhh… think of it this way, Beepy:"
    pro "If you tire yourself out, it'll make the rest that comes after that much more fulfilling, right?"
    bp "...I {i}really{/i} hate it when you use my own logic against me…"

    "The two demons faced off against each other in the middle of the ring. Their retainers stood at the sidelines, staring daggers at one another."
    "The tension was thick; you could cut it with a katana."
    pro "You're in for quite a rude awakening, Countess. Beepy's defenses are utterly impenetrable."

    st "It was a blast of concentrated love! It's the most powerful force in the world!"

    pro "Oh. I guess that explains everything."

    pro "Ufufu~ With the authority of Raum, I conjure a quake that will render your humble abodes to rubble!"
