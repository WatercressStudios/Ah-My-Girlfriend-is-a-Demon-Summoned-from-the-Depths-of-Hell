    "When you’re a demon overlord who has powers beyond human comprehension, you expect fervent cooperation from anyone and everyone."
    "Surely, one would not think to question my motivations when their existence could be erased at the drop of a hat."
    "But every once in a while, you encounter a loathsome individual who refuses to bend their knee, opting instead to challenge your almighty providence."
    "And unfortunately for me… my sister is one of those people."

    #enter Yumi stage left, show Yumi annoyed

    sis "Are you serious, Makoto? Do you think I’d {i}really{/i} take those demons anywhere?"
    pro "Wh-What’s the big deal? They just want to go to the supermarket and pick up a few things."
    sis "Is that all? Are you sure they also don’t want to order some human souls as takeout?"
    pro "I’m pretty sure. One of them just thinks about food all the time."
    pro "You know, like… {i}food{/i} food. No body parts of any sort."

    #show Yumi annoyed, eyes closed

    sis "Ugh, jeez. This was exactly what I was afraid of…"
    sis "I look away from the mess you’ve made for one second, and we already have {i}more{/i} of them  to worry about!"
    sis "How are Mom and Dad gonna react when they find out we’ve let literal demons hang out with us!?"
    pro "T-Take it easy, Yumi! Beepy’s only gonna be around for a month anyway!"

    #show Yumi concerned, looking to the side

    sis "I wouldn’t be surprised if our punishment lasted longer than that."
    sis "Can’t you at least take {i}some{/i} responsibility for all this?"
    pro "O-Of course I will! All I gotta do is keep them in line and help them out with whatever…"
    pro "And in exchange, they’ll teach me all sorts of dark arts!"

    #show Yumi skeptical

    sis "...Come again?"
    pro "That’s what their offer was, and I’d be a fool to not accept it! It’ll be the beginning of a brave new world, one in which I--"

    #show Yumi annoyed, eyes closed

    sis "Okay, just stop."
    sis "I already have enough to worry about and your stupid gimmick isn’t helping."
    pro "Erk--!"

    "She’s not budging an inch! Not even my phenomenal cosmic powers are doing anything to change her mind!"
    "I mean, not like that’s ever worked before - but still…!"

    sis "*Sigh* Look, I don’t get half of what’s going on here. I’m amazed I managed to get a grip on things the first time…"
    sis "But… you summoned a demon yesterday, and now that demon’s brought other demons with her!"

    #show Yumi concerned

    sis "It’s demons here, demons there, demons all over the place! How can I {i}not{/i} be worried?"
    pro "I-I mean, they haven’t really done anything yet."
    sis "I know, but…"
    sis "*Sigh* Whatever. Maybe I’m overthinking things, I dunno."
    sis "Can you at least promise they won’t make a mess of the place?"
    pro "I, uh… sure! They won’t trash the place!"
    sis "Somehow, that doesn’t ease my worries…"

    "At this point, Yumi finally picks herself up off the bed and makes her way out of her room."

    sis "At the very least, you should introduce me to them so I know what I’m getting into."
    pro "But of course! I shall lead the way posthaste!"

    #scene livingroom

    "I lead her back downstairs in a manner similar to how one would use the Bifröst Bridge to reach Asgard."
    "Once she sees the demons, she recognizes their lack of hostility - but is still a little on edge."
    "We decide to skip the lengthy introductions this time, opting just to use their titles and nicknames."
    "I doubt my sister would have appreciated their subtleties anyway…"

    #enter Yumi stage right
    #enter twins stage left

    sis "So just to be clear… you’re {i}not{/i} gonna end up leaving a crater where this house is, right?"
    mm "Of course not! What kinda guests you takin’ us for!?"
    sis "Oh, nonono, that’s not what I meant, haha! I-I’m just…"
    sis "I guess I’ve always associated demons with, like, ‘fire and brimstone, rrrr big evil!’"
    bb "Brimstone is yucky! It’s really dirty, and it tastes gross!"
    sis "Ahahaha... R-Right."

    #enter Lucy stage left

    lu "I-I’m really sorry about showing up unannounced… W-We can find somewhere else to stay if this is too inconvenient for you!"
    sis "Oh, you’re fine; don’t worry about it."
    sis "Honestly, I’m surprised anyone would wanna hang around my little bro, much less bring more friends to meet him."
    sis "You’re pretty familiar with him by now, right?"
    lu "Oh, we’ve seen how he acts, a-and he’s very, um…"
    lu "H-How do I put this…?"
    mm "He’s lame."
    bb "Yeah! Super lame-o!"

    "The twins have a laugh at my expense. I’m half a step away from calling Satan and having her take them back."

    mm "But we do wanna help him out. He’s got a duel comin’ up, after all."

    #show Yumi surprised

    sis "A duel…?"
    pro "It is a fated battle between me and my arch-nemesis, the Everlasting Matriarch of the Stars, over the right to claim the school as our own!"

    #show Yumi skeptical

    sis "Okay, when you say it like that, it makes me assume you’re talking about some made-up person."
    pro "D-Don’t you want to at least give me some support here!?"
    sis "Bro, you’ve got enough weird fantasies already, what’s one more on the pile?"

    #show Yumi concerned

    sis "Which reminds me… How are we gonna take all these guys out in public?"
    sis "I really doubt anyone will just see a demon and act like nothing happened."
    lu "Oh, y-you don’t have to worry about us!"
    lu "We use a special kind of cloaking magic s-so that no one can see us… N-Not normally, anyway."
    lu "Certain people who have summoned demons become influenced by their presence, allowing them to see other demons."
    lu "It doesn’t happen a whole lot, though, b-because demon summonings have become a lot rarer nowadays…"

    #show Yumi surprised

    sis "Wait a second. If that’s true… then how come I can see you guys just fine?"
    sis "I don’t think I had a hand in that summoning ritual, so I shouldn’t even be seeing you guys right now."
    lu "Really? How strange…"
    pro "Perhaps you’ve had the blood of a demon lord flowing through your veins all along, and seeing demons just comes naturally to you!"

    #show Yumi annoyed

    sis "That’s {i}fucking{/i} stupid, Makoto."

    "That’s by far the quickest rebuttal I’ve ever seen."
    "She may deny it now, but I have faith that Yumi will awaken to her own dark powers in due time…"

    bb "Hey hey, are we going yet?"
    bb "We’ve been talking for too long and I’m getting hungry! I wanna go get food right now!"

    #show Yumi nervous

    sis "Alright, alright… I guess I don’t have much choice, do I?"

    #show Yumi confident

    sis "But if anyone’s paying for groceries, it’ll be you, Makoto."
    pro "What!? Why me!?"

    #show Yumi annoyed

    sis "Uh, do I {i}need{/i} a reason?"
    pro "...Good point."
    bb "Yay~! C’mon c’mon, let’s go let’s go~!"

    #exit Lucy, twins, and Yumi stage right

    "Without much else to say on the matter, everyone makes their way to the garage - everyone except for Beepy, that is."

    #enter Beepy stage left

    pro "You, uh… coming with us?"
    bp "...Nah. Think I’d rather just lie around here. Bringing those three over was exhausting…"

    #show Beepy smiling

    bp "Don’t worry about me… You go have fun with everyone else."
    pro "...If you say so."

    "Strange that Beepy doesn’t want to come with us - especially not after everything that’s happened today."
    "Well, she’ll be fine so long as she doesn’t sneak into my room again…"
    "But there’s no time for me to go back and examine the locks. Now, I must begin my preparations for what lies ahead."

    pro "We’ll be back soon."
    bp "Take your time…"

    #scene black

    "With our farewells exchanged, I follow everyone else into the garage."
