    "Tuesday. The most accursed day of the week."
    "The foolish, unenlightened masses regularly assume that Monday is the worst out their lot -  but Tuesday is where the true despair begins."
    "They convince themselves that things won't be so bad, but as soon as Tuesday comes, they realize there is no escape."
    "They have already become slaves to another mundane moment of existence - and it is too late to break away when they finally realize their mistake."
    "And the only thing they can do to keep themselves from succumbing to insanity is to bear the weight of their burden until the week is over."
    "Yes, Tuesday is the one day of the week where human anguish and misery reach their absolute peak…"
    "...Which makes things perfect for me."
    "But who am I, you ask?"

    pro "Come now, have you truly forgotten me?"
    pro "You may have no idea who I am, but I know the faces of all the pathetic mortals in this realm."
    pro "But just for your sake, I suppose it’s best to tell you..."

    #show pro’s face growing increasingly maniacal

    pro "Like an errant lightning bolt from the heavens cast down onto the Earth, I appear to set the world ablaze!"
    pro "I am an existence unparalleled by any before me! I am a true being of ultimate power - a god amongst men!"
    pro "You stand in the presence of Sebastian Wolfgang IV, the Chaotic Lord of Thunder, the one that will bring this world to its--"

    "*BANG! BANG! BANG!*"

    pro "H-Huh!?"
    sis "Hey, keep it down in there! I'm trying to study!"
    pro "G-Go away, Yumi! I'm in the middle of something important right now!"
    sis "Don't gimme that, Makoto. You're just in there talking to yourself, aren't you?"
    pro "M-My name isn’t Makoto! Not anymore…"
    sis "Come on, you’re in high school now. Do you really have the time for this nonsense right now?"
    pro "Look, I-I’ll be done in here soon, j-just gimme a few more minutes, alright!?"
    sis "*sigh* Whatever. Just try to wrap up whatever you're doing soon, okay?"
    pro "Okay..."

    "I could hear that vile person’s steps as she walked away."
    "Damn it, my concentration is all messed up! Who does she think she is, interrupting a demon lord in the middle of his monologue!?"
    "Now I gotta get back into character and recount my spiel all over again. Alright, from the top…"

    "Tuesday: a day fraught with disaster and despair."
    "Wait, that doesn’t sound right…"
    "Tuesday: a mediocre day in a mediocre existence that highlights our mundane mediocrity for all to see."
    "Ugh, no, that sounds stupid. Too much alliteration, maybe?"
    "What did I even say the first time…?"
    "...You know what, forget it! Let's just continue from where I left off."

    pro "Yes, it is I, Sebastian Wolfgang IV, all powerful commander of demons and ultimate terror!"
    pro "Now that you know who I am and what I am capable of, I can see the fear trickling down your face like the blood from a fresh wound."
    pro "But fear not, my dear; I shall not consume your soul and erase you from existence quite yet."
    pro "No, I will instead make you watch as I finally unleash my full power onto the world and bring it to its knees!"
    pro "For you see, I have been preparing for a day like this for a long time - and now I shall attempt what no other mortal has dared attempt before…"

    #show pro’s face growing increasingly maniacal

    pro "Yes, I shall perform a demon summoning!"
    pro "You were a fool to think you could challenge my authority and claim my powers to be false - or worse, mere make-believe!"
    pro "But little do you realize that I have now finished all my preparations, and I shall begin my incantations on this very night!"
    pro "In just a few short Earth hours, I will call forth a demon of unimaginable power who will obey my every command without hesitation!"
    pro "And once they are in this world, I will use their power to create a new world order. All of the insignificant insects shall bow before me, or burn!"
    pro "Not even you - o’ degenerate fool that you are - will realize what a mistake you’ve made when you have seen the error of your ways and finally recognized my awesome power!"
    pro "After I bring the world to ruin, I’ll crush you in an instant and watch your blood taint the rivers!"
    pro "And atop your mangled corpse, I will {b}rule over all of creation!{/b}"
    pro "Hahahaha… {i}{b}Aaaahahahahaha!!!{/b}{/i}"

    "My attempt to escape this mundane existence was over as soon as it started."
    "In an instant, I’ve gone from Sebastian Wolfgang IV, a thousand year-old practitioner of the dark arts…"
    "...back to Makoto Takaya - a boring, normal high schooler with absolutely nothing special about him."
    "It’s frustrating, but not completely unexpected. I’ve grown used to having my fantasies dashed time and again."
    "But every time I get dragged back into reality, it's a reminder of how bothersome it is."
    "And the most bothersome force at that moment just so happened to be…"

    #show sis with annoyed expression

    "...My sister, Yumi."
    "She usually knows her place and leaves me to my own devices, but every once in awhile she comes along to take the wind out of my sails."
    "If I could be considered a raging wildfire consuming all in my path, then she could be likened to a rainstorm that quells those flames."
    "In other words, she's a complete nuisance."

    #sis "Don't look at me like that. I just wanna know what you were doing in there."

    "Was that all? Come now, dear sister, are you sure you weren't going to relay my tactics to any enemy spies?"
    "That's just like her, prying into a dark overlord’s business. Well, I suppose I can overlook this slight - just this once…"
    "...Especially considering I’m actually in a good mood today."

    pro "Heh. If you must know, o’ sibling of flesh and blood, I was busy preparing myself."
    pro "Surely even you understand what that means by now, right?"

    #show sis smiling sarcastically, with eyes half closed

    sis "You mean you were letting the whole neighborhood know what a dork you are?"
    pro "D-Dork!?"

    "Leave it to Yumi to misunderstand the subtle nuances of my existence. I guess I’ll have to spell it out in big, bold letters."

    pro "Hmph! You won’t be making such trite quips for long, dear sister!"
    pro "For you see… I will be summoning a demon into this realm!"

    #show sis surprised, have a question mark symbol briefly appear

    sis "Wait… ‘summoning a demon…?’"
    pro "Of course! It will be an all-powerful, almighty soldier of Hell who will follow my orders without question!"
    pro "With its power, I will lay waste to my enemies and conquer the world!"

    #show sis smiling sarcastically, with eyes half closed

    sis "You really think an all-powerful demon would follow a scrawny thing like you?"

    "Ignore that comment, Sebastian. She knows not the forces she is dealing with."
    "I wouldn’t be surprised if she doesn’t have a single idea of what I was talking about, either."

    #show sis looking quizzical

    sis "Who was that ‘degenerate fool’ you were talking about anyways?"
    pro "Huh!?"

    "Welp, spoke too soon."

    pro "Y-You mean you were listening in on me!?"
    sis "Uh, yeah; kinda hard not to when I could hear you from anywhere in the house."

    "Dammit, I was a fool to do my monologuing in the bathroom! Are there any safe havens left in this cruel world? Is nothing sacred!?"

    pro "Th-That is none of your concern! I assure you, I will have everything dealt with in due time!"

    #show sis with annoyed expression, eyes closed

    sis "Look, I don’t really care what you do with this whole ‘dark lord’ business, but just try to keep yourself from doing anything stupid, alright?"
    sis "Mom and Dad may be off to Kamakura for awhile, but that doesn’t give you carte blanche to make a mess of things while they’re gone."

    #show sis with worried expression

    sis "So… just try to behave yourself, okay?"
    pro "Sure…"

    #exit sis stage left

    "Satisfied with my response, Yumi walks away without another word…"
    "...She leaves me there, stewing in my own embarrassment. My mortal sibling has to butt in every chance she can get, doesn’t she?"
    "I can practically see the headlines: ‘Dark Overlord of Destruction Stopped by Nagging Sister!’ It’s enough to make me vomit."
    "But nothing is going to stop me now. Not even the one mortal who knows my thousand-year history on this Earth."
    "I have everything I need to perform the summoning… Now all that’s left is to perform the incantations."
    "I glance back to my reflection in the bathroom mirror and give it a knowing, sinister smirk."

    pro "Plain old Makoto will behave himself - but Sebastian Wolfgang IV cannot be held down by mere mortals."

    "With confidence surging through me, I began walking towards my destiny…"
