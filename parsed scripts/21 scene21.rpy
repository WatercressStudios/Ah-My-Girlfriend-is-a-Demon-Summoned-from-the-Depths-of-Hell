    "Satan’s business card."

    "While it’s foolish to think I can cover as much ground as Elizabeth by using the exact same method, this is the best shot I have."

    "Though she failed to realize it, I was far more powerful than she was before our duel was set. While there’s a frightening possibility that Satan’s help allowed her to catch up to me, she couldn’t have gotten too far ahead."

    "With only a few hours of Satan’s time, I could easily make up the difference and then some."

    "I feel my temper rising, and then I realize:"

    "I’m trying to contact a demon of wrath! Her entire {i}existence{/i} revolves around petty inconvenience."

    "And so, to get audience with her, I have to make it inconvenient for myself!"

    "I take this opportunity to study the tomes I’ve been hoarding - not for the knowledge itself per se, but to fool Fate into believing it would be inconvenient for me to be taken off hold."

    "However, I slowly find myself fascinated by the arcane rituals that lay before me."

    "Yes! This is it! I don’t need Satan at all! If I just master this, Elizabeth’s defeat will be in the palm of my hand! I just need--"

    pro "No, I am {i}not{/i} okay! I learned nothing of the dark arts from you lot, so I sought the aid of Satan herself."

    pro "But all she did was temper my fury!"

    bp "Well, I mean, that’s... kinda what she does? Satan of Wrath? Ring any bells?"

    pro "Then what’s {i}your{/i} excuse?"

    pro "You and the others have limitless arcane potential, yet all you do is waste my time with flowery nonsense!"

    bp "Whoah, there, cowboy. You’re kinda missing the point, here."

    pro "The point? I have a fight to the death tomorrow! {i}That’s{/i} the point!"

    bp "No, not, like, the chuuni point. I mean the real people point."

    bp "We don’t really do that whole ‘granting otherworldly powers to mortals’ thing. It’s a hell of a lawsuit, y’know?"

    bp "Literally."

    pro "What? You’re {i}demons!{/i} What are you if not harbingers of destruction and chaos!?"

    bp "Ouch! Check your privilege there, dude."

    bp "You can’t just trust everything you see in comic books, movies, and venerated religious texts."

    bp "Demons are around to help people! Just, y’know, not conventionally."

    bp "No preaching or anything - that’s more the angels’ style, and if one of them stopped by instead of me, they’d have sent your ass to military school by now."

    bp "But we don’t really indulge people’s desires to rain unholy destruction on their playground bullies and exes, either."

    bp "Instead, we just sorta... help people to help themselves."

    bp "The things you humans call vices can just be ways of taking care of yourselves."

    pro "Hah! You speak of vices? Don’t you realize you’re talking to a demon lord? Sin is my entire domain!"

    bp "Yeah, that’s real edgy of you and all, but, um... Not really?"

    bp "Indulging in your vices is just engaging with the world around you, y’know? Actually having desires and making decisions for yourself an’ stuff."

    bp "But you just sorta hide in your little fantasy, so you don’t really do any of that."

    bp "Pretty ironic, buuuut... because of the whole demon lord thing, you’re actually pure as the driven snow!"

    "Me? Pure? This... monster doesn’t know who she’s dealing with!"

    pro "And so you aim to correct that? What fool would take life advice from a demon?"

    bp "Uh, weren’t you just saying you were a demon lord or whatever? A little consistency’d be nice."

    bp "I mean, too much sin is obviously bad for you, but drinking too much water will kill you, too."

    bp "But there’s a lot to gain if you just use some moderation."

    bp "Sloth will tell you when to conserve your energy - and with a little bit of pride, you’ll know when you deserve better."

    bp "Greed and gluttony... Well, let’s be real, they’re basically the same thing, but they can tell you to go after the things that make you happy."

    bp "Envy sorta does the same thing, too, and wrath will get you to change the things you don’t like."

    bp "And hey! With enough lust, you just might cut the tsundere bullshit and start making out with that little arch-nemesis of yours."

    pro "What? Th-That... With a foul enchantress such as... Are you insane?"

    bp "See, this is what I’m talking about! You’re simultaneously the least {i}and{/i} most serious person I’ve ever met, and it just... doesn’t look all that healthy!"

    bp "So whaddya say? Why not just relax a bit~?"

    pro "You... would ask that I cast aside my title as a lord of demons?"

    bp "I guess? I mean, maybe not all at once. Just bring it down to like, a six? ‘Cuz right now you’re at a fifty."

    bp "And the scale only goes to ten."

    pro "That’s... utterly foolish. I am a demon lord, through and through. It’s not merely something that I can stop, like... something... stoppable."

    bp "Right, right. Just... I think you could benefit from a few friends, and the edge is... {i}kiiiiinda{/i} getting in the way."

    pro "Edge? It’s not edge, it’s a dark miasma, which... and a demon lord is a lone wolf that… works alone and..."

    bp "Yeah, just... Look, I’m trying not to preach, or anything. Really."

    bp "But just because I’m not gonna tell you the answers doesn’t mean I won’t ask the questions."

    bp "I mean, what do you actually {i}get{/i} out of the whole demon lord thing? Is it actually worth it?"

    pro "Worth it? Of {i}course{/i} it’s worth it! I could have untold arcane powers right at my fingertips!"

    bp "Right. Yeah. Demon powers. But, like, what would you {i}do{/i} with them?"

    "..."

    "What?"

    pro "Th-That’s... I would... smite my enemies, and enact my will upon... things."

    bp "See? Your whole plan is all vague and shit."

    bp "So hey! Let’s say instead of demon lording or whatever, you come watch another movie? Just for tonight."

    pro "It isn’t vague, and it isn’t ‘demon lording or whatever!’"

    pro "Stop looking down on my.. activities! They’re important! They have... they have cosmic... um... and... I don’t..."

    pro "{i}Fuck you!{/i}"

    bp "..."

    bp "Sheesh, fine. Serves me right for putting so much effort into something..."

    bp "Sorry. I’ll go ahead and leave you alone."

    "What a... nuisance."

    "Indulging in vices? Give me a break."

    "I am the greatest evil humanity has ever known, and after tomorrow, I’ll finally have proof."

    "I’ve merely transcended their definition of sin to create my own. That’s all."

    "And I am not... pure as the driven snow."
