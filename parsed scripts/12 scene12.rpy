    "At last, another tedious and tiresome school day draws to a close."
    "I feel drained and weary all at once, like Samson without his flowing mane of hair."
    "Each monotonous day threatens to end my reign of terror before it ever truly begins."
    "But now… it {i}has{/i} ended, and I have returned to my humble abode."
    "I am not expecting much of a welcome; my progenitors are still away, and my sister is at odds with me after my summoning ritual."
    "I’m not even sure if Beepy managed to make it back home. She might be napping somewhere on a street corner for all I know."
    "Oh well; there’s not much I can do about that."
    "Better for me to head inside and relax than worry about things beyond my control."
