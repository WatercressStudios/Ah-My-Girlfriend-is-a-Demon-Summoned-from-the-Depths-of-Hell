    "Eventually, we each go our separate ways, Misaki and Satan exit the supermarket early, to the sadness of the two demons and the indifference of myself."
    "Once we had everything we needed, we - {i}I{/i} paid and left, the voices of the two demons squabbling behind me."

    "We enter the carpark, the legion of people I saw before having vanished into the late afternoon." 
    "Where they go I don't know - probably to their unassuming, unexciting suburban life, if I had to guess."
    "I see my sister - the demon Lucifer alongside her - at the car, and I push the trolley across the parking lot."
    "The weight feels almost Sisyphean, in a way."

    sis "You done?"
    pro "Yes. We have finished our… gathering."
    sis "Cool."

    "She moves, hoisting up the trunk of the car above her head and letting it hang."

    sis "Okay, put your stuff in--"
    mm "{b}Uwaaaaa--!{/b}"

    "A scream - piercing, louder than the judgement of the gods - sounded through the parking lot. I turn, unsure of who the noise is coming from. A banshee? A mandrake? A child?"
    "...None of the above, apparently."

    mm "Where is it? {b}Where is it!?{/b}"
    lu "W-where's what?"

    "Personally, I am asking the same question as Lucifer, myself."

    mm "M-My necklace… it's gone!"
    pro "...Gone?"
    mm "I've lost it, I've dropped it, I-I might not be able to have it again, I…"

    "She trails, looking off."
    "Honestly, I'm not sure how one could even lose something they had placed on their neck, but I suppose I wouldn't know. I've never worn one, after all."

    bb "Aww, sucks that it {i}vanished,{/i} sis. How do you think you lost it?"
    mm "I don't… I can't… I… I had it."
    mm "Did I drop it…? No, of course not, but then..."

    "She seems... despondent, in a way. Incapable of response, as if she had seen what laid on the deepest circles of Hell and lived to tell the tale."
    "Of course, she almost certainly had."

    lu "Do you want to, um, find it?"
    mm "I… please… I…"
    bb "Don't we need to go homeeeeee, though?"
    mm "...Are you stupid?"
    bb "...No?"
    mm "{i}Do you not understand the importance of this necklace?{/i}"
    bb "...Why should I?"
    mm "Tch. Typical."

    "My sister sighs."

    sis "...We can wait a bit, I suppose. I can pack the car while you go look."
    lu "...And I can help! I've got an eye for detail, so, um…"
    mm "Y-You can help?"
    pro "Me too, if this bothers you that much."

    "Truth be told, I would rather be heading home by now - but given Mammon's… reaction, I suppose that there wasn't much of a choice. As the summoner, I seemed to be her master, and what sort of master would voluntarily let their subjects suffer?"
    "A lot of masters, probably, but not me. I give the trolley to my sister, nod as she takes it, and walk to where the other three are."
    "They are looking at me somewhat expectantly. Their eyes bore into me. The words that come out of my mouth are stilted. Stuttery."

    pro "So, uh, what do we do?"
    lu "We look. I know how to look for these things, so, uh…"
    bb "This is {i}boooooorrrrrrrriiiiinnnnnnggggg{/i}..."
    pro "Go help my, uh, sister then."
    bb "Okkkkaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy..."

    "She leaves, and as she does so we look through the labyrinthine parking lot; we take our separate paths wordlessly for the sake of efficiency."
    "Now that the sun is nearly gone from the sky, there are almost no mortals inhabiting this parking lot. That is… convenient. Preferable, even. If I had to bump into someone, if I had to talk to someone who had no idea what the depths of this world were, I..."
    "...Wouldn't know what to do. And {i}God{/i} knew what would happen if the Demon Lord Sebastian Wolfgang IV was caught off guard."
    "But now was not the time for unlikely hypotheticals. I had a necklace I needed to find. I turned a corner and saw a new part of the parking lot. Cars. Abandoned trolleys. Litter."
    "Eventually, I see a glint under one of the dumpsters. I walk forward, slightly curious. Is that what I'm looking for? Is that the thing Mammon covets so dearly? I'm not entirely sure."
    "Still, I suppose there is no harm in looking. I walk to the dumpster, pick the… chain thing up, and--"

    mm "{b}Mine!{/b}"

    "A force appears with the speed of a lightning bolt and wrenches the thing from my hands just as I am about to look at it. My body jolts. I look around. The sensation, the {i}thoughts{/i} are familiar. Is this…?"

    mm "You found it. {i}You found it~!{/i}"

    "In front of me is Mammon, bent over slightly. She is clutching, caressing the necklace, She isn't looking at me, nor the two demons coming up from behind her; she is only looking at the object in her hands."
    "Her {i}precious{/i} possession, as expected from the lord of greed."
    "I question how much it means, given her… extreme reaction."

    pro "What's so important about that necklace, anyway? You're fawning over it."

    "To be honest, I would have preferred to ask why losing it prompted such a reaction from her, but I suppose that this is the… better way of asking it."

    mm "It's…"

    "She pauses. Shakes her head. Continues."

    mm "It's a necklace that my friend Leviathan gave to me, back… around a year ago, I guess."
    mm "Admittedly it… might not be the most valuable; admittedly, I only took it because Levi made it, but…"
    mm "That's sort of the reason, y'know?"
    mm "Like, Levi's a friend. She's not really my {i}bestest{/i} friend or anything like that but, like…"
    mm "I still value her."
    mm "I still care about her."
    mm "And I care enough to know that she's the type of person who doesn't really make friends easily, who compares herself to others and looks down on everything bad they do."
    mm "But I know that she sees herself as worse than others as well. I know she's jealous of other people. I know she wants to be on their level. I know that she expects what she makes to be the best, I know she wants others to care about her things."
    mm "So how would she feel if I had suddenly lost the necklace she had made for me?"
    mm "How would she feel if it seemed like what she did hadn't mattered?"

    "Honestly, I don't know anything about this 'Levi' person, but I nod. The least I can do is pretend I understand."

    mm "And it's… like that with everyone. All my friends. All my family. I try to keep the things they give me. I try to show them that their gifts matter."
    mm "I don't want to lose them; I don't want them to dislike me... I want to show them that they're important; I want to show them that I care."
    mm "I guess that's why this necklace is important to me."

    "Hm."
    "Interesting."
    "I knew that Mammon in front of me was the embodiment of greed..."
    "...but I supposed I never really saw that possessiveness as a good thing."
    "Hoarding things, keeping them just because you value the people who gave them to you."
    "I guess I will need to hold Mammon in a different light."

    bb "Aww, you found it? I thought I did a good job of hiding it…"

    "Beelzebub and Lucifer walk onto the scene - the former with a sort of exaggerated frown on her face as her sister turns around, glaring at her."

    mm "{i}You{/i} hid this?"
    bb "Yep!"
    mm "You…"
    bb "...got like, super flustered and stuff."

    "She giggles. You hear about twins finishing each other's sentences, but… I'm pretty sure that isn't what Mami's thinking."
    "What Mami's actually thinking...  would probably raise the age rating of this game."

    bb "It was great! You were like 'wa, wa, my precious necklace was gone,' and--"

    "Mammon gives a sort of scoffing sound."

    mm "Of course someone like {i}you{/i} wouldn't understand."
    bb "Huh?"
    mm "You just guzzle and consume whatever you can get your hands on and fail to take any of the {i}value{/i} out of it!"
    bb "...Yeah. So?"

    "A moment of silence, before Mammon sighs."

    mm "Whatever, no point in arguing. Let's just go home. {i}One{/i} of us needs to act like an adult, after all."
    bb "Oh, right. There's something I need to tell you."

    "She turns to me."

    bb "Your sis got tired of waiting so she decided to take the stuff home without us."

    "..."
    "{i}What.{/i}"
    mm "{i}What.{/i}"
    lu "Wh-What?"

    bb "Yeah, she said that we could just walk home. Apparently doesn't take that long."

    "Of all the--"

    mm "Fine. Let's just… walk, yeah."
    lu "W-We might be able to make it back before sundown if w-we begin now."
    mm "Right. I guess we start walking now?"
    pro "Yes. We should."

    "And off we went."
