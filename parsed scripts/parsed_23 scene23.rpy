    "So many jumbled thoughts flowing in all at once… I’m not even sure what day it is right now."
    "...I cast a glance towards my calendar, following the days that are marked off until I reach the present."
    "It’s Friday."
    "The day of the fated battle."
    "The day I face Misaki and put an end to our feud."
    "I wish I could be more excited - but after last night,  it’s hard for me to even think about it."
    "And I know that all of my training will be for naught if my mind is clouded…"
    "...God, what am I even saying? Who cares about that!?"
    "This doesn’t have anything to do with that; this is about making things right."
    "Before I can even think about what to do with Misaki… I have to talk with Beepy."
    "I need to tell her that she was right."
    "Not just her, but everyone else, too. They deserve an apology just as much."
    "With my mind made up, I freshen up and head out of my room."
