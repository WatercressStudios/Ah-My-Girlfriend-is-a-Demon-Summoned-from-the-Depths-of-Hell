    "At long last, we finally reach my dwelling. Eager to leave the land of mortals, I head toward my room."
    "But unfortunately, I have more pressing matters to tend to."

    sis "So, how was your walk?"
    pro "You don’t wanna know."
    sis "I don’t! Besides, you know, we had frozens. You don’t seriously expect me to let those melt, do you?"
    pro "You stand before three demons and a demon lord! We could just do an ice incantation!"
    bb "Uh... Ice incantations?"
    mm "{i}Yeeeeaaaah,{/i} hate to break it to you, but most of us are the fire and brimstone type."
    lu "U-Um, I know some ice spells, but I’m not really any good at them, so..."
    pro "...Well, I could have done it, of course, but I’m running a little low on mana."

    sis "Yeah, you’re a real fearsome bunch and all, but have you considered the help of a mortal artifact?"

    sis "It’s called a {i}freezer.{/i}."
    bb "Food’s in the freezer? Got it!"

    bb "So? You eat before everyone else all the time!"

    sis "Oh, shut up. Beepy is already working on dinner for everyone anyways."

    "..."

    "What?"

    "What sort of arcane...?"

    "I extend a hand to Yumi’s shoulder."

    pro "Yumi, I’m... so proud of you."
    sis "Excuse me?"

    pro "For years, you’ve rejected your calling! Though you carry the blood of a sorcerer in your veins just as much - no, perhaps even more than I - your emotional state has always sealed your true potential!"

    pro "But now you’ve awoken, and your latent talent has allowed you to surpass even my years of study!"

    sis "What the hell are you on about this time?"

    pro "Isn’t it obvious?"

    pro "Beepy would never do something as useful as making dinner, let alone for other people! Even though I couldn’t, you must have become cognizant of your powers and started to control her!"

    bp "Nah. I was just reheating the leftover pizza. There’s even enough for everyone."

    "She sets it down in front of us."

    bb "Finally!"

    mm "Hey! Take one at a time!"

    bb "But if you steal it from me, then {i}you{/i} have two! How’s that fair!?"

    mm "It’s because you started it! You stole from me like, 20 minutes ago!"

    "We decide to ignore the two of them - no matter how difficult it is."
    "I guess I’ll just consider it part of my training, or something like that."

    pro "I see... I suppose the use of a microwave is within even Beepy’s capabilities - and so it seems my sister’s potential continues to slumber."

    bp "Pssshh. The {i}microwave?{/i}"

    #music cuts out again

    bp "Everyone knows that if you {i}really{/i} want to reheat pizza, you’ve gotta use the oven."

    "Then..."

    "There’s only one explanation."

    "I put my arm on Yumi’s shoulder. Again."

    pro "Yumi... I take it back. The power stored within your veins has been unleashed after all."

    #music comes back

    sis "You’re an idiot."

    lu "A-Also, power being in the veins is just a common misconception. It’s actually stored in the arteries..."

    bp "Jeeeeeez. You think that {i}just{/i} because I’m a demon personifying sloth, I’ve gotta do everything the easy way?"

    pro "Um... Yes?"

    bp "Oh, really? What next? Electric eels are electric?"

    pro "They are!"

    bp "And killer whales kill things?"

    pro "Yes!"

    bp "And red pandas are red?"

    pro "Ye-- Well, actually, it’s more of an orange. But in comparison to a normal panda? Yes!"

    bp "But you know what? An electric eel isn’t an eel, a killer whale isn’t a whale, and a red panda isn’t a panda!"

    bp "Your expectations can be wrong where you least expect it~!"

    pro "What does that have to do with you putting so much effort into reheating pizza?"

    bp "Nothin’. Just thought you might be able to relax with some fun animal trivia."

    pro "Relax?! A battle deciding the fates of the two most powerful demon lords in the tri-state area will be upon us in less than two days, and you expect me to {i}relax!?{/i}"

    bp "...The hell is a tri-state area?"

    pro "What I need to do is prepare myself for Armageddon!"

    bp "Oh. ‘Kay."

    sis "The only ‘Armageddon’ here is what you did to the garage."

    "What? What sort of foul development...?"

    sis "Really about time you dealt with that, don’t you think?"

    "No! The dusk has already been consumed by these meaningless errands! The rest of this night {i}must{/i} be devoted to my training!"

    "I try to slip away, but Yumi’s arm latches onto me like a serpent’s... um, mouth?"

    sis "You’re not getting out of it this time! For fuck’s sake, just finish it already!"

    "It seems that my freedom has been compromised. Though it’s unbecoming for one of my station to yield, I can’t overcome my sister’s powers - even if they lay dormant."

    "Also she’s squeezing my arm really hard and I want her to stop."

    pro "...Fine. If you truly find it to be such a burden, I will purify the arcane residue brought about by my ritual. But in exchange--"

    sis "No exchange. Just do it."

    "Tch. Not even my powers of suggestion will be effective here."

    pro "If that duel ends in my defeat, my blood will be on your hands."

    sis "I’m shockingly okay with that."

    "Damn it all... If fortune is on my side, then perhaps Elizabeth is being put through these same sorts of trials. She did the same ritual, after all. Then, perhaps, we may yet be on even footing."

    "I grab my instruments of purification - disguised as mere soap and a towel - from the closet, and pour holy water from the sink into a sacred vessel. With prudence, I may be able to salvage some experience from this."

    "But when I finally make it to the battlefield..."

    pro "W-What?"

    bp "Iunno. I got bored when I was in your backpack, so I looked through some of your stuff. Thought bringing it up might prove my identity or somethin’."

    pro "But... that was the only possible explanation...!"

    pro "And that isn’t a {i}doodle!{/i} It is a complex ritual to assist in the conjuring of a beast by developing an image from which it can manifest!"

    bp "Yeah, whatever. I just figured your sis might make you clean the garage, so I went ahead and did it for ya."

    bp "So now we can just relax for the rest of the night~!"

    pro "Hmm... This is fantastic! Now I can spend this time preparing for my duel! Thanks to your support, Elizabeth’s demise will surely be at hand!"

    #sad music

    bp "...Oh."

    bp "Okay."

    bp "I mean..."

    bp "I just thought, y’know, since I made you pizza - in the oven and everything - and cleaned the garage for you... you might spare a little bit of time to hang out with me."

    bp "Especially because without my help you would’ve been stuck scrubbing the floor all night."

    bp "But I guess your responsibilities are just... too important."

    "Agh!"

    "What’s going on!?"

    "I..."

    "Even as a demon lord, I cannot abide by an atrocity of this magnitude!"

    pro "Beepy! Wait!"

    bp "What? You want me to get Yumi to drive you somewhere? A nice place that’s too far away for that annoying Beepy to distract you from your super important training?"

    pro "No, that’s not it. We should make each other’s acquaintance! Just for a bit!"

    "Just as I begin to think that, Beepy abducts me to the living room. She sits me on the couch and snuggles up next to me before covering the two of us under an outright absurd number of blankets."

    "With the stage set, she turns on the TV and starts channel-surfing."

    bp "Whoaaaah! I’ve wanted to see this movie for weeks now! And whaddya know! It’s just starting!"

    bp "What a {i}crazy{/i} coincidence!"
     
    "Don’t tell me."

    "Was this all part of some diabolical plot?"

    "And if so, how long has it been in motion?"

    "Regardless, I’m her prisoner. Until this movie ends, these blankets may as well be made of concrete. No, worse - {i}magic resistant{/i} concrete. Needless to say, I’m not going anywhere."

    "The movie itself seems to be about a society that consists entirely of giant robots. The giant robots can’t talk, so all they ever do is fight."

    "However, a group of teenaged giant robots runs into alien technology that gives each of them the power to release a human from their cockpit and control it remotely."

    "With this power, they get the ability to talk through their disputes. A group of evil robots ends up having this same power, but the teenagers use their superior communication skills to persuade the villains into a different course of action."

    "Before I know it, the film reaches its end."

    bp "Yowza! I thought that’d be pretentious, but it really was as good as they said!"

    bp "What’d you think, Makoto? Have a good time?"

    pro "For the last time, call me--!"

    bp "C’mooon, it’s no big deal. Relax, relax~"

    "First you steal two hours of my time, and now my dignity?"

    "Demons are more fierce than I could have ever known. And yet..."

    pro "...It was nice. I prefer the content of my eldritch texts, but as a brief intermission, I suppose it was an acceptable use of my time."

    bp "But it was a {i}way{/i} better time than you would’ve had practicing for that dumb magic show you have in two days, right?"

    pro "Hmph. What is two hours of enjoyment when put up against the potential for infinite power?"

    bp "...Eh. Guess that’s the best I could’ve gotten out of a sourpuss like you."

    pro "Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to rejuvenate my energy in preparation for my next journey to the mortal realm."

    "But this fight isn’t over. Cleverly, I check all around my room just in case she’s played some sort of trick. Under the bed, in all the drawers, in the closet - even my backpack. No sign of her."
