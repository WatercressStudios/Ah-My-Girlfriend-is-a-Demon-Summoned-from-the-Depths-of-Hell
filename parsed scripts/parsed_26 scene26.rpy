    "A teacher was at the front, kicking back in his seat. I recognize him from science."

    "He was shaking his head as he said this. I wanted to cut him down to size. I didn't need his pity nor his condescension." 
    "Instead, I remained silent. After all the hullabaloo on the rooftop, my energy is utterly drained."
    "Glancing aside to Misaki, she seems similarly quiet - the most quiet I've seen her in some time."
    "Like a barely restrained animal, she glares daggers at the councillor. Up front, and from his throne of power, he's largely unphased."
    tea "Well… I hope you kids don't mind if I duck out to get a coffee. Don't tell on me to the principal, okay?"
    tea "Haha… ha…"
    "He laughed, trying to lighten the mood. There was no response."
    tea "Well, you guys just stay put and… think about what you done."
    tea "...It's not like I want to be here anymore than you guys do, so…" 
    "Excusing himself, he moved to exit the classroom."
