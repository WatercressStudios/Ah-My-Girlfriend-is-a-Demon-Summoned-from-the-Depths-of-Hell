scene1_754f745a		She usually knows her place and leaves me to my own devices, but every once in awhile she comes along to take the wind out of my sails.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	175
scene1_0a731290		If I could be considered a raging wildfire consuming all in my path, then she could be likened to a rainstorm that quells those flames.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	176
scene1_ae0dd1c8		In other words, she's a complete nuisance.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	177
scene1_1b5a0a3b	sis	Don't look at me like that. I just wanna know what you were doing in there.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	181

scene1_c4e0e83f		Leave it to Yumi to misunderstand the subtle nuances of my existence. I guess I’ll have to spell it out in big, bold letters.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	204

scene1_3301a135	sis	Uh, yeah; kinda hard not to when I could hear you from anywhere in the house.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	262
scene1_763afda9		Dammit, I was a fool to do my monologuing in the bathroom! Are there any safe havens left in this cruel world? Is nothing sacred!?	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	266
scene1_22b6172a	pro	Th-That is none of your concern! I assure you, I will have everything dealt with in due time!	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	269
scene1_6eebcdb8	sis	Look, I don’t really care what you do with this whole ‘dark lord’ business, but just try to keep yourself from doing anything stupid, alright?	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	275
scene1_33066b6f	sis	Mom and Dad may be off to Kamakura for awhile, but that doesn’t give you carte blanche to make a mess of things while they’re gone.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	280

scene1_6c35c1b9		...She leaves me there, stewing in my own embarrassment. My mortal sibling has to butt in every chance she can get, doesn’t she?	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	295
scene1_77191b43		I can practically see the headlines: ‘Dark Overlord of Destruction Stopped by Nagging Sister!’ It’s enough to make me vomit.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	296
scene1_a3f81447		But nothing is going to stop me now. Not even the one mortal who knows my thousand-year history on this Earth.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	297
scene1_737c0907		I have everything I need to perform the summoning… Now all that’s left is to perform the incantations.	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	298

scene1_4ea540a9		With confidence surging through me, I began walking towards my destiny…	game/scripts/parsed_01 scene1.rpy	305
scene2_ef06d89b		Today is a new day. If I am to overcome the trials that stand before me, I must redouble my efforts.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	6

scene2_e0f0a5c4		They… probably won't mind - I hope. To be safe, I'll clean up before they get back.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	18
scene2_aea751c2		In all likelihood, they're engaging in {i}some{/i} kind of wicked vice regardless. They're off in Kamakura, doing whatever it is adults do on their anniversary.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	19
scene2_12a1517b		The garage’s design is perfect for my aspirations. I have been burning incense for the past fifteen minutes in preparation...	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	20
scene2_0cd37cd2		A white and a black candle are placed on two sides. The white, symbolizing the hypocrisies of those who would deride the darkest magics…	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	21
scene2_38eda763		...And the black candle, to serve as a representation {i}of{/i} those darkest magics. Balanced in equilibrium.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	22

scene2_3e259965		It’s as if I can witness the threads of fate coiling before me - as if I can reach in and twist them to my eldritch whims.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	28
scene2_e77f64db		My plan is simple: while I have not gathered enough power to shed the trappings of this mortal husk…	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	29
scene2_69f67f24		...There are greater powers to consult.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	30
scene2_4dfaaeaa		I will make an offering to the Dark One, then consort and make a bargain for yet greater power - power that will overcome the greatest tribulation I have encountered yet.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	31
scene2_322ebbc8		The cost is of no concern. I am already a demon.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	32

scene2_252deddd		Performing an invocation on a student budget is a challenge, after all. Sacrifices were necessary - and not the fun ones.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	39
scene2_9bce7c05		I’m afraid a chalice crafted from genuine silver was… too decadent for this humble practitioner of black magic.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	40
scene2_071cfc79		Spray-painting an ordinary chalice with silver paint, however, proved to be a more affordable alternative.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	45
scene2_e710ae49		A show of thriftiness that would please Mammon of Greed himself.	game/scripts/parsed_02 scene2.rpy	46

scene11_116263a3		There’s hardly anything about how the conjurors of the past would carry out their rituals; it would be more exciting to learn about than some dumb crusades.	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	93
scene11_15dfb4bb		Of course, it would {i}also{/i} be too much for their fragile, mortal minds to comprehend…	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	94

scene11_f0310b18		I had suggested we study the history and practice of alchemy instead, but the teacher grew more stone-faced than a Nurikabe.	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	96

scene11_6f9f205a		...Until she ended up sticking me with Beepy.	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	109

scene11_684c0cb3		She’s kind of a nag, to boot - like Yumi, but even more intrusive.	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	111

scene11_1130d3ff		And now, we must settle the score with a climactic battle in just two Earth days.	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	118
scene11_fc54f92f		I can feel the overwhelming odds stacked against me. With Satan in her corner, I don’t think I stand a chance.	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	119
scene11_8048bb94		But I have to try. No demon lord would admit defeat so easily, and I cannot let her steal that which is rightfully mine.	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	120
scene11_c2b70807		I must double my efforts and train harder than ever before! By the time my training is complete, they’ll be begging for mercy on judgement day!	game/scripts/parsed_11 scene11.rpy	121
